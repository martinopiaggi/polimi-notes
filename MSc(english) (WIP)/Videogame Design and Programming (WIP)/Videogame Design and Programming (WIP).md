- "A game is the voluntary attempt to overcome unnecessary obstacles" Bernard Suits, The Grasshopper (1978)
- Attempt to create a definition that encompassed all kinds of games (Sports, Board Games, Make Believe)
- Accurate definition of game, but doesn't teaching designers how to make good games
- Referred to make believe as "open games"
- A game with the sole goal of continuance of the game
- However, some open games have other goals



- "A game is a series of interesting decisions" - Sid Meier
- States very little about what the word game means
- But states a lot about his personal beliefs about what makes a good game
- What makes a decision interesting?
- The player has multiple valid options from which to choose
- Each option has both positive and negative potential consequences
- The outcome of each option is predictable but not guaranteed
- Second designer's goal: interesting decisions


- "A game is a closed, formal system that engages players in a structured conflict and resolves its uncertainty in an unequal outcome" - Tracy Fullerton, Game Design Workshop (2008)
Not just a definition of game, but also a list of elements that designers can modify
- Formal elements: The elements that differentiate a game from other types of media
- Dynamic systems: Methods of interaction that evolve as the game is played
- Conflict structure: The ways in which players interact
- Uncertainty: The interaction between randomness, determinism, and player strategy.
- Unequal outcome: How does the game end?
Do players win, lose, or something else?



- "A game is a problem-solving activity, approached with a playful attitude" Jesse Schell, The Art of Game Design (2008)
The playful attitude of the player defines a game
- Two runners are in a race
- One is running a normal race
- The other is aware that there is a bomb at the finish line that she must defuse
- Only one of the two is playing a game!
Third designer's goal: lusory attitude
- From the Latin word for play, training, \& sport, Ludus
- Games should encourage the lusory attitude of players


- "A game is a system of rules in which agents compete by making ambiguous, endogenously meaningful decisions" - Keith Burgun, Game Design Theory (20/3)
Specific terms
- Ambiguous: predictable but uncertain
- Endogenously Meaningul: meaninguul in the game system
Intentionally limited
- Much more restricted definition than Suits or Schell
- Omits play activities like make believe and competitions of skill (including sports)
Burgun attempts to restrict the definition to make it easier to understand the bounds of the field



- "A game is a system in which players engage in an artificial conflict, defined by rules, that results in a quantifiable outcome." Salen \& Zimmerman




Definitions help you understand what people expect
- Especially true if you're working in a specific genre or for a specific audience.
- Understanding how people defined the term will help you to craft better games for them
Definitions can lead you to understand also the periphery
- Games that fit the definition perfectly, and those on the edge
- The peripheries are where new genres can be created
Definitions can help you speak eloquently with others in the field.
- You should also read the source material for all of these definitions to expand your understanding of game design



## Game Analysis Framework 


### MDA: Mechanics, Dynamics, and Aesthetics

It consists of three key elements: 

- Mechanics refer to the specific components of the game, such as data representation and algorithms. It focuses on the technical aspects of how the game functions.
- Dynamics, on the other hand, examine the runtime behavior of the mechanics. It explores how the mechanics interact with each other and with player inputs over time.
- Aesthetics consider the emotional responses evoked in players when they interact with the game system. It examines the overall experience and the impact it has on the player.

By utilizing this framework, game analysts can gain a deeper understanding of the inner workings and player experience of a game. It provides a structured approach to assess the different layers of a game and evaluate its overall effectiveness.


Designers and players view games from different directions • Designers first consider the aesthetic feelings that they want players to experience – Then consider the dynamic play that will engender these aesthetics –Finally create mechanics that will lead to these dynamics • Players first read the rules of the game (mechanics) – These rules lead to dynamic play – The dynamics engender aesthetic feelings

When it comes to games, designers and players have different perspectives. Designers focus on creating aesthetic feelings for players to experience. They begin by considering the desired emotions and atmosphere. Then, they think about the dynamic gameplay that will evoke these aesthetics. Finally, they create mechanics that will guide the players towards these dynamics.

In contrast, players start their gaming experience by reading and understanding the rules (mechanics) of the game. These rules then lead to dynamic gameplay. Through this gameplay, players are able to experience the desired aesthetic feelings that the designers have intended.

- Aesthetic: Describe how the game is perceived by the five senses (vision, sound, small, taste, touch) • Many different aspects of aesthetics (soundtrack, 3D graphics and animation, packaging, etc.) • Different from aesthetics in MDA – MDA aesthetics describes the emotional response –Schell's aesthetics describe the five senses
- Mechanics: Rules for interaction between the player and the game • Differentiate games from other non-interactive media • Contain – Rules – Objectives – Other Formal elements • Different from mechanics in MDA –Schell differentiates between mechanics and technology 
- Story: Everything included in Fullerton's Dramatic Elements • Differs from Fullerton's Dramatic Elements because it is broader than what she terms story. • Schell's story includes premise and character as well
- Technology: The underlying technology that makes the game work • Digital technologies – Computer and console hardware –Software and programming – Rendering software and pipelines • Paper technologies – Dice and other randomizers –Statistics tables


### Formal, Dramatic, and Dynamic Elements


- Formal elements
	- A game ceases to be a game if the formal elements are removed
	- The elements that make games different from other forms of media or interaction and provide the structure of a game. Formal elements include things like rules, resources, and boundaries.
- Dramatic elements
	- The story and narrative of the game, including the premise. Dramatic elements tie the game together, help players understand the rules, and encourage the player to become emotionally invested in the outcome of the game.
- Dynamic elements
	- They occur only when the game is being played
	- The game in motion. Once players turn the rules into actual gameplay, the game has moved into dynamic elements. Dynamic elements include things like strategy, behavior, and relationships between game entities

Objectives + Rules = Conflict


Formal elements 


- Player interaction pattern
		- How do the players interact? Single-player, one-on-one, team versus team, unilateral (one player versus all the other players), cooperative, etc. Many digital games are “single player versus game” or, more recently, fall into the category “multilateral competition” • There is however a lot of potential in other patterns that is rarely exploited. Interaction patterns:
		- Single player vs game 
		- Multiple individual players vs game
		- Player vs player 
		- Unilateral competition (Dead by Daylight)
		- Multilateral competition
		- Cooperative play
		- Team competition
- Objective
		-What are the players trying to achieve in the game?
		-When has someone won the game?
- Rules
		- Limit the players' actions by telling them what they may and may not do in the game
		- Many rules are explicit, but others are implicitly understood
- Procedures
	- A rule tells the player what to do, the procedure dictated by that rule is the actual action of the player
	- They guide player behavior, creating interactions that would probably never take place outside the authority of the game
	- Procedures are often defined by the interaction of a number of rules
	- Some procedures are also outside of the rules like for example bluffing in Poker
- Resources
	- Elements that have value in the game
	- For example, money, health, items, property, etc.		
- Boundaries: Where does the game end and reality begin?
	- "A game is a temporary world where the rules of the game apply rather than the rules of the ordinary world" - Johan Huizinga, Homo Ludens (1955)
	- This concept is now known as the Magic Circle
	- In a sport like football or ice hockey, the magic circle is defined by the boundaries of the playing field
	- In an Alternative Reality Game like I Love Bees (the ARG for Halo 2), the boundaries are more vague
- Outcome: How did the game end?
	- It needs to be uncertain
	- We can final (Chess) and incremental outcomes (RPGs)

Most successful teams showcased all the core elements of the game at the prototype presentation

After the prototype presentation they had all the feedback they needed to improve the game!

Then, they spent the remaining time polishing the prototype and doing level design

Most successful teams put a lot of effort in showcasing their work

They do everything possible to test as many options as possible

They work their best to get the most feedback from players

They listen to players they don't try to convince them that their game is good!

Immediately identify and focus on the core elements of your game

Set deadlines and be strict about them! 

Set intermediate milestones and be strict about them!

Important decision must be made as soon as possible

Emergence

- Simple rules lead to complex and unpredictable behavior
- One of a game designer's most important jobs is to attempt to understand the emergent implications of the rules in a game.

Playtesting is the only way to understand dynamics

- Game systems are unpredictable
- Experienced game designers can make better guesses
- But, everyone must playtest to understand a game

Can we engineer fun? 

"When we meet noise, and fail to see a pattern in it, we get frustrated, and give up."

Our love for patterns can be related to dopamine. Recognize a pattern gives us a dopamine peak and in some sense it's why human loves patterns!

The level design follows a basic formula: guiding the player to understand a core mechanic or pattern that will be essential in more complex situations later on.



Many developers always lose their objectivity during production.

Theory of Un-Fun
If you find something in the game that is not fun (or un-fun) remove it. After you have removed all the un-fun, all that should be left is the fun.


But "it's very hard to delete something on which you worked a lot"

- Theory of Fun for Game Design
	- Players love digestible patterns!



Four concepts related to challenge and have a deep connection to one another are skill, strategy, chance, and uncertainty

Skill is the degree to which a player has mastered an action within a game

Strategy is the ability of the player to determine the best ways to perform the actions of the game in order to achieve their goals.



Chess: skill and strategy 
Roulette: uncertainty 
Basketball: skill,strategy,uncertanty 
Poker: skill, uncertanty a little bit of strategy 


Decision-Making and Feedback
- Games require players constantly evaluate what is happening while continuing to carry out their actions in the game
- "action-outcome unit" (Katie Salen and Eric Zimmerman)
- All play experiences are made of a sequence of actions that have outcomes that lead to the next action and lead to the next outcome
- Ultimately, game-play is made up of hundreds or thousands, of small decisions that each creates a change in the game's state.
- From these, play experiences emerge, shaped along the way by the goals and subgoals, however loose or strong they might be.

related to "emergence"


A well-designed game provides feedback on player actions.

When a player does something-move the left stick on a controller, for example-the object moves to the left.

But there are other forms of feedback in the game, too, that are essential to the player knowing what is going on.






What is the Game Design Document?

Game development is inherently collaborative!

Communicating the overall vision of the game to all the team member is essential.

The most effective way is to write down the vision as well as a detailed plan for executing it


GDD is a blueprint:

- GDD as memory: game design involves numerous critical decisions that shape the mechanics and purpose of the game. Despite the initial impression that important ideas will be remembered, it is surprisingly easy to forget even the most basic decisions and solutions. Therefore, it is crucial to document these design decisions to avoid unnecessary repetition and problem-solving efforts.
- GDD for communication: Communication of design decisions is an important process that involves dialogue and feedback. When these decisions are documented, they can be reviewed and improved upon by others, promoting collaboration and allowing more people to contribute to the design process. The design document also helps in identifying and resolving weaknesses in the game design at an earlier stage. Additionally, it serves as a reference point to address any disputes or disagreements regarding the implementation of the design.


Design History

- A design document is a continuously changing reference tool
- Alert teammates about any significant modifications or updates
- The design history contains a section for every major change made
- When using a wiki, this section will be replaced by the editing history feature of the software


The magic template doesn't exist. The design document is like a bible for the game, generally **everything** from the first sketch to the last one has to be kept in the DD. 


In general, a game design document contain

- Overview and vision statement
- Gameplay
- Characters (if applicable)
- Story (if applicable)
- World (if applicable)
- Media list
- Technical specification (if applicable)


- All the design decisions
- All the development decisions
- The list of tasks with the deadline and the people in charge of completing them
- The changelog of the GDD tracking all the updates including the commits to the Github repository
