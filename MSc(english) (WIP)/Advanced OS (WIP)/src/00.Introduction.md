The main features of an OS are:

- Resource management (CPU(s) and IO bandwidth)
- Isolation and protection (Memory and access control)
- Portability of applications and extensibility 


A program is a sequence of computer instructions that is stored somewhere but not currently being executed. An application is a user-oriented concept of a computer program, often used to describe programs with a graphical user interface (GUI).

A process is an instance of a program that is currently being executed. It has its own isolated memory address space and can contain one or more threads. A thread is the smallest schedulable unit of execution within a process. Threads belong to the memory address space of a process and share this space with other threads of the same process. They can be synchronized, access qglobal memory areas and variables of other threads.

Threads also have a private address space, but communication between threads can only occur with the help of the operating system through inter-process communication (IPC). Threads execute sequentially on the CPU, although there are exceptions such as hardware parallelism.

In the context of Linux, the term "task" is often used interchangeably with "thread" to refer to a single unit of computation at a conceptual level.
