A Virtual Machine (VM) is an effective, isolated replication of an actual computer designed for running a specific operating system (OS). It's based on a virtual machine monitor (VMM), also known as a **hypervisor**, which emulates a computing environment nearly identical to that of the original machine, with minimal impact on performance. The VMM has total control over system resources, ensuring:

- **Fidelity**: The VM behaves in the same way as the real machine.
- **Safety**: The VM is restricted from bypassing the VMM's management of virtualized resources.
- **Efficiency**: Programs running within the VM experience little to no significant drop in performance.

The reasons for using a virtual machine are numerous:

- **Consolidation**: Multiple VMs can run on a single physical machine, maximizing hardware utilization by running one machine at full capacity instead of multiple machines at partial capacity.
- **Adaptability**: VMs can quickly adjust to changing workloads.
- **Cost Reduction**: Data centers can reduce both hardware and administrative expenses.
- **Scalability**: VMs can be easily scaled horizontally to meet increased demands.
- **Standardization**: They provide a standardized infrastructure across different environments.
- **Security and Reliability**: VMs offer secure sandboxing for applications and can enhance fault tolerance.

There are two types of hypervisors:

- **Type 1 Hypervisor**: Also known as a native or bare-metal hypervisor, it operates directly on the hardware without an underlying host OS.
- **Type 2 Hypervisor**: This runs on top of a host operating system, like KVM or VirtualBox.

Instructions that the processor can execute are categorized as unprivileged (safe for user mode) and privileged (which are restricted and can cause a trap if executed in user mode). The concept of virtualization involves running these privileged instructions in a controlled, less-privileged mode.

An instruction is considered virtualization-sensitive if it either:

- **Controls Sensitive**: Directly changes the machine status, like enabling or disabling interrupts.
- **Behavior Sensitive**: Operates differently depending on whether it's executed in user or supervisor mode, which can impact fidelity.

Virtualization can be achieved through:

1. **Software-Based** (de-privileging): 
	- Privileged instructions from the guest are intercepted and emulated by the hypervisor.
	- Binary translation is used when direct emulation isn't feasible for virtualization-sensitive instructions.
	- "Trap and emulate" 
1. **Hardware-Assisted**: 
	  - Modern processors offer built-in support for virtualization, making it easier and more efficient. These processors have additional modes for guest and hypervisor operations, separate from the standard user and supervisor modes.
	   - In this hardware-assisted mode, the guest operating system functions almost at native speeds, with hypervisor intervention required only for specific tasks such as manipulating page tables.
	   - Improved performance, especially for system calls that can be executed without hypervisor intervention.
	   - Easier recovery of guest state for managing traps, thanks to hardware support.
	   - Reduced overhead and memory usage compared to methods involving binary translation.
	   - Some instructions need to be trapped, fetched, and executed by the hypervisor, whereas in software-based virtualization, they can be directly transformed into emulation routines (e.g., memory tracing).
	   - Certain operations require a full round-trip between the virtual machine monitor (VMM) and guest, whereas in software-based virtualization, they can be performed on a virtual chipset.
	   - The control path for page faults may result in higher overhead for hardware-assisted virtualization compared to software-based approaches.

Intel Vanderpool Technology, also known as VT-x, is Intel's virtualization technology for the x86 platform, aimed at simplifying the software used for virtual machines by addressing vulnerabilities in virtualization. Some of the issues it addresses are:

1. Lack of separation: Only using two rings for the operating system and applications can lead to a lack of separation. VT-x helps overcome this problem.
2. Untrapped instructions: Certain instructions like popf are not trapped at ring 1, causing security vulnerabilities. VT-x solves this issue.
3. Excessive trapping: In virtualization, excessive trapping can occur, leading to performance degradation. VT-x helps manage trapping more efficiently.

Sensitive instructions do trap, but privileged instructions affect the state within the virtual CPU, represented in the Virtual Machine Control Block (VMCB), rather than always trapping.
In the Linux kernel, the KVM module enables VT-x (or AMD-V) support, allowing the kernel to function as a hypervisor.



The VMCB contains the following:

- Guest state: the state of the processor that is saved and restored when exiting and entering the virtual machine.
- Host state: the state of the processor that is restored upon exiting the virtual machine.
- Execution control: specifies how to handle interrupts when the guest operating system is running.
- Specifies whether certain instructions, such as manipulating $\mathrm{cr} 3$, should be considered sensitive.
- Exit reason: indicates why the virtual machine exited, such as due to I/O access and which register was involved.
- Enter and exit control: used, for example, when the machine is in root mode and receives an interrupt but the guest has disabled interrupts. It informs the VMM to trap when interrupts are reenabled.




### KVM

- KVM (Kernel-based Virtual Machine) is a virtualization technology in the Linux kernel.
- It allows Linux to be a hypervisor, converting it into a type 1 hypervisor.
- Linux provides necessary components for virtual machines (VMs) like memory management, scheduling, and I/O.
- VMs run like threads within Linux.
- Linux versions 2007 or later with x86 processor virtualization support are needed to use KVM.
- Two kernel modules must be loaded for KVM to work.
- VMs can directly access devices for better I/O performance.
- The VFIO driver allows user space drivers to securely access devices in an IOMMU protected environment.
- Modern systems have DMA and interrupt remapping facilities for I/O device boundaries.
- KVM replaces the need for a custom virtual machine monitor (VMM).
- KVM originally used a forked version of QEMU, but now it is merged into the main QEMU project. QEMU can be used as a VMM with KVM by enabling the `--enable-kvm` switch. QEMU provides preexisting emulated devices and efficient access through the VIRTIO interface.


#### Memory overcommitment 

Memory overcommitment in virtualization allows assigning more memory to virtual machines (VMs) than the physical memory available. For example, on a server with 15GB of memory, you could run more than fifteen 1GB VMs if each VM only uses part of its allocated memory. This is possible because KVM treats VMs as processes, which can use more memory than is physically present due to Linux's virtual memory system.


#### Balooning

Ballooning is a memory management technique used in virtualized environments. It helps to ensure that the amount of physical memory used by virtual machines (VMs) stays within specified limits. This process works as follows:

- A special driver (often called the balloon driver) is installed within the guest operating system of the VM.
- When the hypervisor needs to reclaim physical memory, it instructs the balloon driver to "inflate" by allocating some of the VM's memory to itself, effectively reducing the memory available to the VM.
- This inflation can cause the guest operating system to start swapping, moving less frequently used memory pages to disk storage, which slows down access to those pages but frees up physical memory.
- The guest OS decides which memory pages to swap out or release back to the hypervisor.

In essence, ballooning allows a hypervisor to dynamically adjust the amount of physical memory available to VMs, based on overall system demand and the limits set by an administrator.


#### Kernel same-page merging 

KSM (Kernel Same-page Merging) is a feature in Linux designed to save memory across multiple processes or VMs. It works by:

1. Identifying physical pages with identical content.
2. Leaving one copy of the content intact.
3. Remapping all other virtual pages that had duplicates to point to the single physical copy.
4. Releasing the surplus physical pages for other uses.
5. Setting the virtual pages to 'copy-on-write', meaning if a process tries to modify the shared page, a new copy is made to avoid altering the shared content.

Originally developed for KVM, KSM can benefit any application with redundant data. However, it's computationally intensive to compare memory pages, so it should be used judiciously.



## Containerization 


Containers are a way to isolate a set of processes and make them think that they are the only ones running on the machine.

The machine they see may feature only a subset of the resources actually available on the entire machine (e.g., less memory, less disk space, less CPUs, less network bandwidth).

Containers are not virtual machines:

- Processes running inside a container are normal processes running on the host kernel.
- There is no guest kernel running inside the container
- You cannot run an arbitrary operating system in a container, since the kernel is shared with the host (Linux, in our case).

The most important advantage of containers with respect to virtual machines is performance: there is no performance penalty in running an application inside a container compared to running it on the host.

Namespaces are a feature of the Linux kernel that partitions kernel resources such that one set of processes sees one set of resources while another set of processes sees a different set of resources.

The feature works by having the same namespace for a set of resources and processes, but those namespaces refer to distinct resources. Resources may exist in multiple spaces. Examples of such resources are process IDs, hostnames, user IDs, file names, and some names associated with network access, and interprocess communication.

Namespaces are a fundamental aspect of containers on Linux. In this way each process in Linux has its own network namespace, pid namespace, user namespace and a few others.
