# OS drivers code 


## Miosix kernelspace

Most of the work to be done in an OS is writing device drivers.

- A **microprocessor** requires external memories and I/O to operate
- A **microcontroller** is an integrated circuit combining CPU, memories and peripherals. Targeted at embedded and real-time systems.

**Miosix** is a real-time operating system optimized for microcontrollers:

- Supports C and C++ standard libraries and POSIX.
- Used as a platform for distributed real-time systems **research**.
- Userspace is optional, allowing development directly in kernelspace.
- Developed at Politecnico di Milano.

## Linker Script

The **linker script** provides instructions to the linker about how to place various sections of code and data in memory.

- start address of the stack
- maps the program sections into memory regions

In a typical microcontroller setup, memory is divided into several sections, including flash memory for code, RAM for data and stack, and peripheral registers. The memory map varies from one microcontroller to another.

Example of possible addresses:

```markdown
0x00000000: System memory
0x08000000: Flash memory (code)
0x080FFFFF: Flash memory end
0x20000000: RAM (data, stack)
0x2001FFFF: RAM end
0x40000000: Peripheral registers
0xFFFFFFFF: Peripheral registers end
```

The initial part of the kernel needs to be written in assembler to satisfy C/C++ language requirements. 

Common sections and symbols:

- `.isr_vector`: the Interrupt Service Routine (ISR) vectors are essentially pointers to the functions that should be executed in response to various system interrupts. It is crucial for handling of hardware interrupts.
- **`.text`**: Executable instructions.
- **`.data`**: Initialized global and static variables.
- **`.bss`**: Uninitialized global and static variables, zeroed at startup.
- **`.rodata`**: Read-only data (e.g., constants).
- **`_start`, `ENTRY`**: Entry point of the program.
- **`_stack`**: Stack top address (for stack initialization).

Common linker script commands:

- **`ENTRY(symbol)`**: Sets the entry point.
- **`MEMORY`**: Defines named memory regions with attributes (e.g., `rx` for read-execute).
- **`ORIGIN, LENGTH`**: Define the start address and size of a memory region.
- **`SECTIONS`**: Begins section definitions.
- **`>`**: Assigns a section to a memory region.
- **`AT>`**: Places the section at a specific address in memory but locates it in a different region in the output file.
- **`KEEP`**: Prevents garbage collection of sections.
- **`ALIGN`**: Ensures that data structures are aligned to memory boundaries. 
-  **`.`** (dot): Represents the current address in the memory region being filled by the linker as it progresses through the sections. When you assign `.` to a symbol (e.g., `_data = .;`), you're capturing the current address at that point in the linking process, which can be used as a reference by the program at runtime.


Example of a linker script:

```c
ENTRY(Reset_Handler)

MEMORY
{
  flash(rx) : ORIGIN = 0x08000000, LENGTH = 1M  // Flash memory for code and constants
  ram(wx)   : ORIGIN = 0x20000000, LENGTH = 128K  // RAM for data and stack
}

_stack_top = 0x2001FFFF;  // Adjusted to point to the end of RAM

SECTIONS
{
  . = 0;
  .text :  {
    KEEP(*(.isr_vector))  // Ensure ISR vectors remain included by the linker
    *(.text)
    . = ALIGN(4);
    *(.rodata)
  } > flash  // Place code and constants in flash

  .data :  {
    _data = .;
    *(.data)
    . = ALIGN(8);
    _edata = .;
  } AT > ram  // Initialize data in flash, copy to RAM at startup

  _etext = LOADADDR(.data);
  _bss_start = .;
  .bss :  {
    *(.bss)
    . = ALIGN(8);
  } > ram  // Allocate uninitialized data in RAM

  _bss_end = .;
  _end = .;  // Mark end of used memory for heap allocation
}
```


## Bit Manipulation for peripheral registers

To interact with hardware peripherals, we need to access **peripheral registers**. Peripheral registers are memory locations mapped to specific addresses in the processor address space. 
Their addresses are always physical, also in microprocessors.
Most common way used by hardware peripherals to expose their functionality to the software:

1. Data-sheets provide information for each register.
2. Name, address in memory, meaning of all the bits and access permissions.


Most often, we will need to interact with individual bits inside registers: which requires some experience in **bit manipulation**:

**Setting a Bit to 1**: 

To set a specific bit to 1, use the bitwise OR operator (`|`) with a mask where the target bit is 1 and all others are 0.

```c
variable |= 1 << n;  // Sets the nth bit of variable to 1
```

- `1 << n` shifts 1 to the left by `n` positions, creating a mask with a 1 at the nth bit.
- `|=` modifies `variable` directly, setting its nth bit.

**Clearing a Bit to 0**: 

To clear a specific bit to 0, use the bitwise AND operator (`&`) with a mask where the target bit is 0 and all others are 1.

```c
variable &= ~(1 << n);  // Clears the nth bit of variable to 0
```

- `1 << n` creates a mask with a 1 at the nth bit.
- `~` inverts the mask, turning the nth bit to 0 and all others to 1.
- `&=` modifies `variable` directly, clearing its nth bit.

**Toggling a Bit**: 

To toggle a bit (change 1 to 0 or 0 to 1), use the bitwise XOR operator (`^`) with a mask where the target bit is 1 and all others are 0.

```c
variable ^= 1 << n;  // Toggles the nth bit of variable
```

- `1 << n` creates a mask with a 1 at the nth bit.
- `^=` modifies `variable` directly, toggling its nth bit.

**Checking a Bit's Value**: 

To check if a specific bit is set (1) or not, use the bitwise AND operator (`&`) with a mask where the target bit is 1. If the result is nonzero, the bit is set.

```c
if (variable & (1 << n)) {
    // The nth bit of variable is set
} else {
    // The nth bit of variable is not set
}
```

- `1 << n` creates a mask with a 1 at the nth bit.
- `&` checks the nth bit of `variable`; the result is non-zero if the bit is 1.

Remember that when you perform operations like ((1 << 15) | 5), the numbers involved are **already in binary**, and the operations are carried out on their binary representations: 

- `5`: The decimal number `5` is represented in binary as `101`.
- `1 << 15`: shifts the binary representation of `1` and it left by 15 positions. 

```
1000 0000 0000 0000
OR 0000 0000 0000 0101
   -------------------
   1000 0000 0000 0101
```

## Interrupts and you

1. Why we need interrupts?
2. The only way we know up to now to check whether some hardware condition happened is to check status bits.
3. Repeatedly checking status bits is called polling.
4. There is an inherent tradeoff between responsiveness to events, and polling period.
5. Some events may be sporadic.
6. Interrupts can be thought as letting hardware call a software function when an event occurs.
7. When the interrupt occurs, the CPU is executing some other userspace or kernelspace code.
8. Interrupts can pause the normal code execution in between any two assembly instructions and jump to a function, the "interrupt service routine (ISR)".
9. On certain architectures, higher priority interrupts can even interrupt lower priority ones (interrupt nesting).
10. When the interrupt service routine has completed, the processor reverts back to executing the normal code.
11. Interrupts are always run to completion, an interrupt must never block, or it will block all normal code (the entire OS + applications).
12. Interrupts should be written to be as fast as possible, in order to minimize the time interference with the main code (interrupts can insert lag anywhere in the normal code, reducing its time determinism).

## The hardware supporting interrupts

1. Interrupts require cooperation between three hardware components.
2. The peripheral.
3. The interrupt controller.
4. The CPU.
5. In a microcontroller.
6. All three components are inside the same chip.
7. However, they are not transparent to software.
8. Device drivers need to interact with all three for interrupts to work.

## The hardware supporting interrupts

1. The CPU contains the logic for interrupt execution.
2. It has a global bit to enable/disable all interrupts.
3. OSes provide locks that use this bit to protect critical sections between interrupts and normal code.
4. When peripherals request interrupt execution while interrupts are disabled, interrupt requests remain pending, and will be executed when interrupts are enabled again.

## The hardware supporting interrupts

1. The ARM interrupt controller has three bits for each peripheral.
2. If the enable bit is 0, interrupt requests from that peripheral are ignored.
3. The pending and active bit will be explained in detail later.
4. The active interrupt is the one whose interrupt service routine is executing on the CPU.
5. Pending interrupts are interrupt requests scheduled for execution.
6. If multiple interrupt requests are raised at the same time, a priority logic decides which interrupt is executed first.
7. The other requests become pending.

## The hardware supporting interrupts

1. Each peripheral has multiple events that can generate an interrupt.
2. Each event has an individual enable bit to let software decide which events should generate interrupts.
3. Each of event has an event (status) bit, signaling that the event occurred.
4. If an interrupt is not enabled for that event, software can still do polling on the event bit.
5. A single line goes from the peripheral to the interrupt controller.

1. For each interrupt source, the interrupt controller implements a state machine with the pending and active bits.
2. Assume a peripheral signals an interrupt while the global enable bit is set, and the CPU is executing normal code.
3. The interrupt state goes from "not pending, not active" to "not pending, active".
4. It remains in this state as long as the CPU is executing the ISR.
5. After the ISR completes its execution, the same ISR is called again, and the state changes to "not pending, active".

## Concurrency when interrupts are involved

1. Execution of interrupts vs normal code is not symmetric.
2. Interrupts interrupt normal code, the reverse is not possible.
3. We can't use a mutex to protect critical sections with interrupts.
4. With a mutex, any call can block, and blocking in an interrupt is a deadlock for the entire OS.
5. A working approach (for single core CPUs such as microcontrollers) is interrupts just access the shared variables.
6. Normal code disables interrupts when accessing shared variables.
7. Interrupts occurring during this time become pending and run later.


## Linux Kernel Space

In this section, we delve into Linux kernel space programming, focusing on device driver development. The Linux kernel operates in a virtual address space, with peripherals mapped at physical addresses, necessitating special functions for interaction.

**volatile** keyword is necessary to disable compiler optimizations.

### Accessing PORT-BASED Peripheral Registers 

To access **PORT-BASED** hardware registers within the Linux kernel, especially on Intel x86 architectures, the following functions are employed with their respective purposes:

- `request_region(start, length, name);`: Allocates a specific range of **I/O ports** for exclusive use by a device driver, ensuring no port collisions occur when new devices are added to the system.
	- `start`: The beginning of the IO port range you want to control.
	- `length`: The number of IO ports in the range.
	- `name`: A name for the IO region, usually the name of your driver, which helps in debugging and tracking resource usage.
- `release_region()`: Frees the range of I/O ports previously allocated with `request_region()`, making them available for others to use.
- `inb()`: Reads a byte (8 bits) from a specified port, commonly used for accessing device registers.
- `inw()`: Reads a word (16 bits) from a specified port, suitable for devices where data is organized in 16-bit chunks.
- `inl()`: Retrieves a long word (32 bits) from a given port, used for wider data transactions typical in modern devices.
- `outb()`: Writes a byte (8 bits) to a specified port, allowing the control of device behavior or configuration.
- `outw()`: Sends a word (16 bits) to a designated port, useful for setting device parameters that require 16-bit values.
- `outl()`: Outputs a long word (32 bits) to a defined port, used for devices that require larger data or configuration words.



`request_region`

- **Purpose:** This function is used to request control of a range of IO ports for your device driver, ensuring that no other driver can access the same IO space while you control it. This helps prevent conflicts between drivers trying to access the same hardware resources.
- **Usage:** 

`outb` and `outw`

- **Purpose:** These functions are used to write data to an IO port. `outb` is used for writing a byte (8 bits) of data, and `outw` is used for writing a word (typically 16 bits) of data. These functions allow your software to communicate with hardware devices by sending them commands or data.
- **Usage:**
  - `outb(value, port);`
    - `value`: The byte of data you want to send to the device.
    - `port`: The IO port address where the device is connected.
  - `outw(value, port);`
    - `value`: The word of data you want to send to the device.
    - `port`: The IO port address where the device is connected.

These functions are part of the low-level interface that allows kernel code (such as device drivers) to interact directly with hardware components. Using these functions correctly requires a good understanding of the hardware you're working with, including its datasheet and how it expects to receive commands and data.



### Handling Concurrency in the Linux Kernel

The Linux kernel employs its own API for concurrency, as POSIX standards are **not** supported within the kernel space.

**Creating and Managing Kernel Threads**:

  ```c
  task_struct *kthread_run(int (*threadfn)(void *), void *arg, const char *name);
  void kthread_stop(task_struct *t);
  int kthread_should_stop();
  ```

**Mutex for Kernel Threads**:

  ```c
  struct mutex m;
  void mutex_init(struct mutex *m);
  void mutex_lock(struct mutex *m);
  void mutex_unlock(struct mutex *m);
  ```

**Spinlocks for Interrupt Concurrency**:

```c
  struct spinlock_t spinlock;
  void spin_lock_init(spinlock_t *spinlock);
  void spin_lock(spinlock_t *spinlock);
  void spin_unlock(spinlock_t *spinlock);
```

Spinlocks are still used in the Linux kernel due to their simplicity: their minimal overhead in short-duration scenarios (as they avoid the context switch overhead associated with sleeping locks) is especially useful in interrupt contexts within the kernel.

### Blocking and Waiting for an Interrupt

To synchronize normal code execution with interrupt handling, the Linux kernel uses wait queues:

```c
struct wait_queue_head_t waiting;
void init_waitqueue_head(wait_queue_head_t *waiting);
void wait_event_interruptible_lock_irq(wait_queue_head_t *waiting, condition, spinlock_t *spinlock);
void wake_up(wait_queue_head_t *waiting);
```

### The Linux Filesystem

Device drivers in Linux are typically exposed in the `/dev` directory, with file operations managed through a set of function pointers in `struct file_operations`:

```c
ssize_t my_driver_write(struct file *f, const char __user *buf, size_t size, loff_t *o);
ssize_t my_driver_read(struct file *f, char __user *buf, size_t size, loff_t *o);
struct file_operations my_driver_fops = {
  .owner = THIS_MODULE,
  .write = my_driver_write,
  .read = my_driver_read,
};
int major = register_chrdev(0, "name", &my_driver_fops);
unregister_chrdev(major, "name");
```

Explicit data transfer between user space and kernel space is required, utilizing the following functions:

```c
unsigned copy_from_user(void *to, const void __user *from, unsigned n);
unsigned copy_to_user(void __user *to, const void *from, unsigned n);
```

These adjustments ensure that the notes accurately reflect the usage of kernel APIs and synchronization mechanisms, providing a concise overview for Linux kernel space programming, particularly in the context of device driver development.
