# How to choose a (good) topic and to write a (good) paper


It is important to remember that your paper should offer an argument to defend. This argument should consist of a small, specific point that is clearly presented, along with good reasons to support it. It is important to note that most philosophical topics have already been solved, so it is best to choose a problem that is very specific and not too general.
The paper should not consist of a mere report of your opinion, but rather should focus on providing reasons for the claims you are making. Simply summarizing what others have said on the topic will not be enough to create a strong argument. Remember to be clear and concise, and to present a well-reasoned argument to defend your point.

Main points on how to bibliography:

- Include a reference page at the end of the paper
- It is arranged in alphabetical order (typically by the creator)
- Use a consistent citation style (MLA, APA, Chicago, etc.)
- Avoid plagiarism by properly citing all sources used.
