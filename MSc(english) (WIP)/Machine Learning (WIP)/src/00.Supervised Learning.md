# Supervised Learning

It is the most popular and well established learning paradigm. The goal is to learn a good approximation of an unknown function $f$  that maps an input $x$ to an output $y$  with:

- Loss function: a function which says "how much is good the approximation (called $h$) of $f$?"
- Hypothesis space: a subset of the set of all possible function $f$ 

Supervised learning can be used every time we can't clearly explain which is this function. Why shouldn't we know what this function looks like? 

- human cannot perform the task (DNA analysis)
- human cannot explain a clear algorithm (medical image analysis)
- the task continues to change over time (stocks price prediction)
- the task is user-specific (recommender system)

Supervised Learning is divided into:

- [Linear Regression](01.Linear%20Regression.md) 
- [Linear Classification](02.Linear%20Classification.md)
