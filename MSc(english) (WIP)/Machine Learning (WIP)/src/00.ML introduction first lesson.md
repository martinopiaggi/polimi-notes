Machine Learning is a fascinating field of study enabling computers to learn and make inferences from data without the need for explicit programming.  It involves training computer programs to improve their performance over time by learning from experience, ultimately making them perfect for stuff like predicting things or dealing with complex models that can't be solved exactly.
