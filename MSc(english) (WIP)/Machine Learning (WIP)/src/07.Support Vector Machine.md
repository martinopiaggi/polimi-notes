Flexible and theoretically supported method Initially applied to classification only, over the years it has been extended to deal with regression, clustering and anomaly detection problems Idea: find the hyperplane maximizing the margins (distance between the boundary and the points)

Adding a Kernel

he use of kernels in the SVM is almost native (non-parametric method):


Kernel method usually are actually a generalization of linear method, where the only goal is to replace the feature expansion using the kernel, allowing us to work in a very high dimensional feature space paying a cost that is not depending on the **number of samples**. 


In this case SVMs can be seen as a very strong generalization of the Perceptron algorithm
