Steps:

0) analysis of the system
1) evaluation of the canonical rapresentation of the system 
2) computation of the predictor 
3) evaluate the prediction error

Generic **one step** predictor from noise: 

$$\hat{y}(t|t-1)=\frac{C(z)-A(z)}{A(z)}e(t)$$

from data: 

$$\hat{y}(t|t-1)=\frac{C(z)-A(z)}{C(z)}y(t)$$

We would like to minimize the mean squared prediction error:

$$E[y(t+u)-\hat{y}(t+u|t]^{2}]$$

Optimal predictor from the noise:

$$\hat{y}(t+u|t)=\sum_{i=0}^{\infty}w_{u+i}e(t-i).$$


The problem here is that the prediction depends by an infinite series of past samples $e(t)$ with zero mean. 

Diophantine equation

We can solve this using the "Diophantine equation" which basically the formula obtained by a long division from the $W(z)$  : 

![](images/Pasted%20image%2020240320185208.png)

$$W(z)=\frac{C(z)}{A(z)}=\text{long division}=E(z)+\frac{z^{-u}F(z)}{A(z)}$$

where $E(z)$ is the result of the long division, while $F(z)$ is the rest. 

Since $E(z)$ is unpredictable, we will only consider the second part and we can say that:

$$\hat{y}(t+u|t,s)=\frac{F(z)}{C(z)}y(t,s)$$

and in case of no zero mean arma $y(t)=\frac{C(z)}{A(z)}e(t)$ with $e(t)=wn(\mu\lambda ^2)$  it's possible to compute the unbiased $\tilde y(t)$ (removing the mean $\bar y$ and $\mu$ from respectively $y(t)$ and $u(t)$), use the Diophantine equation over the $\tilde y (t)$ and then re add the mean. 
Actually this is not optimal and this formula exists:

$$\hat{y}(t+u|t)=\frac{F(z)}{C(z)}y(t)+(1-\frac{F(1)}{C(1)})\overline{y}$$

where $\overline y$ is the mean of $y(t)$.


And in case of **ARMAX**

Remember that the generic armax process looks like this: 

$$y(t)=\frac{C(z)}{A(z)}e(t)+\frac{B(z)}{A(z)}u(t-1)$$

The prediction of both stochastic and deterministic (exogenous) part: 

$$\hat{y}(t+u|t)=\frac{F(z)}{C(z)}y(t)+\frac{B(z)E(z)}{C(z)}\mu(t-d)$$
