The disciplines: Machine learning: 

> "Machine Learning is the field of study that gives computers the ability to learn without being explicitly programmed." (Arthur Samuel, 1959) 

Statistical learning: it is actually machine learning! 

Machine learning arose as a sub field of Artificial Intelligence, whereas Statistical learning as a sub field of Statistics. Now, the distinction has become more and more blurred.
