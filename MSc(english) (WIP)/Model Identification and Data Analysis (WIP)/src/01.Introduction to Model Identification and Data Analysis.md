Goal of the course is black-box modeling of I/O dynamical systems and time series.

In engineering you usually start from principles and obtain the model. Here we use the data as a source for information to build the model 

Course syllabus: 

1. [Theory of stochastic processes](02.Stochastic%20process.md) 
2. Prediction theory 
3. System identification: machine learning tools for dynamical systems
