## Spectral rapresentation

Spectral density of a stationary stochastic process

![](images/Pasted%20image%2020240320164139.png)

$$\Gamma_{y}(w)=\sum_{\tau=-\infty}^{\infty}\gamma_{y}(\tau)\cdot e^{-jw\tau}$$

For a stationary process $y(t)$, $\Gamma_y(\omega)$ is positive, real, even and periodic with period $T = 2\pi$.

Its graph can be represented in the upper half plane of a 2D plot, as the imaginary part is always zero.

The "general rule" using "the graphical method" is that if the generic point $e^{j\omega}$ is:

- near zeroes $\Gamma _y (\omega)$ is low
- near poles, $\Gamma _y (\omega)$ is high

### Anti-transform formula

The transformation is invertible, and the inverse transform returns the covariance function based on the spectral density, noted as the inverse discrete Fourier transform. 

$$\gamma_{y}(z)=F^{-1}(\Gamma_{y}(\omega))=\frac{1}{2\pi}\int_{-\pi}^{\pi}\Gamma_{y}(\omega) d \omega$$



The spectrum of a $WN$ is constant and equal to its variance:

$$\Gamma_{e}(\omega)==Var[e(t)]=\lambda^{2}$$


## Canonical representation of $SSP$

The spectral factorization theorem plays a crucial role in the analysis of discrete-time signals, particularly through the use of the transfer function $W(z)$. This function is central to understanding how signals can be transformed in the frequency domain.


Backward shift operator $z-1$ which shifts a signal back in time

the forward shift operator $z$  which shifts a signal forward in time.

Linear properties of $z$ and $z-1$ include linearity, recursive application, and linear composition. Using these properties, we can rewrite an AR model equation in terms of $z$ and $z-1$, revealing the relationship between the operators and the AR model.

**Shift Operators in Time Domain Analysis**

The resulting equation shows that the output $y_t$ is the ratio of two polynomials of $z$:

$$y(t)=\frac{c_{0}+c_{1}z^{-1}+\cdots c_{n}z^{n}}{1-a_{1}z^{-1}+\cdots a_{m}z^{-m}}e(t)=\frac{C_{(z)}}{A(z)}e(t)=W(z)e^{it}(t)$$


**Transfer Function as a Digital Filter**

The transfer function $W(z)$, being a ratio of two polynomials, acts as a digital filter. It is instrumental in transforming $WN$ into an ARMA process and is applied in analyzing stationary processes through digital filter theory. 

**Poles and Zeros in Stability Analysis**

Stability analysis involves examining the poles and zeros of the transfer function:

- Zeros are values of $z$ where the transfer function equals zero
- Poles are the inverse of the transfer function's roots (roots of $A(z)$ in case of no cancellations). 

The locations of poles and zeros, particularly within the unit circle in the complex plane, are indicative of system stability. 

-  To compute zeros, set the numerator of the transfer function equal to zero.
-  For poles, set the denominator equal to zero. 


A system is considered asymptotically stable if all poles lie strictly inside the unit circle, and it is deemed a minimum phase system if both poles and zeros reside within the unit circle.

## Final value theorem 


The final value theorem can be applied to Z-transforms that are not in canonical form.

or theorem of the gain is that 

$y(0)=W(1) \cdot U$ 

final value theorem 

$E[y(t)]=W(1) \cdot E[u(t)]$



By fixing the time $\bar{t}$ we obtain a random variable $v(\bar{t},s)=v(\bar{t},\cdot)$.

By fixing the outcome $\bar s$ we obtain the process realization $v(t,\bar{s})=v(\cdot,s)$.


## Fundamental theorem of spectral analysis 

$$\Gamma_{y}(\omega)=|W(z=e^{j\omega)}|^2*\Gamma_{u}(\omega)$$

To apply the fondamental theorem of spectrum analysis also if it's not in the canonical form. 




## ARMA process: multiplicity of representations


ARMA processes can be represented in various domains:

Time domain representation

$$y(t)=a_1y(t-1)+\cdots a_my(t-m)+ c_o e(t)+\cdots c_ne(t-n)$$


Operatorial representation

$$y(t)=\frac{C(z)}{A(z)}e(t)$$


Probabilistic representation

$$y(t)= m_y,\gamma_y(\tau)$$


Frequency domain 

$$y(t)=m_y,\Gamma_y(\omega)$$


They are all equivalent but not unique! This last little aspect it will be problematic, and so before introducing prediction theory, we need to better understand the non-uniqueness property and find ways to make the representation unique.


The theorem says .... $C(z)$ and $A(z)$ are:

1) **monic**: the term with the highest power has coefficient equal to $1$
2) **coprime**: no common factors to that can be simplified
3) have **same degree**
4) have **roots inside the unit circle**




By using Euler's formula, the complex exponentials can be rewritten in terms of cosines and sines. 

$$e^{j\omega } =\cos \omega +j \sin \omega$$
$$e^{-j\omega }=\cos \omega -j\sin \omega$$

Hence, the spectral density function becomes a real-valued function composed of the sum of two cosine terms with frequency ω.


Using Euler's formula, the complex exponential terms in the frequency domain representation can be expressed as a sum of cosine and sine functions, making the spectral density function real-valued and easier to interpret.


Note that in case of $$y(t)=W(z)\mu(t)$$
if $\mu(t)$ is stationary and $W(z)$ is stable, $y(t)$ will be stationary. 



## ARMA process: dynamical representation


If $y(t)=W(z)v(t)$ and: 

- $v(t)$ is stationary
- $W(z)$ is stable 

$y(t)$ is well defined and stationary





## Long division and interpretation of coefficients $W_i$


Using the Long Division Algorithm one can obtain the impulse response representation of it, which is a sort of MA(∞) expression of the process, where W(z) = w0 + w1z −1 + w2z −2 + ... as the result of the long division between C(z) and A(z).




$$\frac{C(z)}{A(z)}=E(z)=>y(t)=E(z)e(t)$$

In general, given any transfer function, we can always write it as above, with the coefficients found with the long division algorithm (that now we will call with the generic notation wi). Let’s analyze the meaning of these coefficients
