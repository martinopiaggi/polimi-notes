# Frequency Domain

## Transfer functions 

The transfer function $W(z)$, being a ratio of two polynomials, acts as a **digital filter**. It is instrumental in transforming $WN$ into an ARMA process and is applied in analyzing stationary processes through digital filter theory. 

**Shift Operators in Time Domain Analysis**

- Backward shift operator $z^{-1}$  shifts a signal back in time
- Forward shift operator $z$  shifts a signal forward in time.

Properties of $z$ and $z^{-1}$ include linearity, recursive application, and linear composition. Using these properties, we can rewrite an AR model equation in terms of $z$ and $z-1$, revealing the relationship between the operators and the AR model.
The resulting equation shows that the output $y_t$ is the **ratio** of two polynomials of $z$:

$$y(t)=\frac{c_{0}+c_{1}z^{-1}+\cdots c_{n}z^{n}}{1-a_{1}z^{-1}+\cdots a_{m}z^{-m}}e(t)=\frac{C_{(z)}}{A(z)}e(t)=W(z)e^{it}(t)$$


## Asymptotically stability 

Stability analysis involves examining the poles of the transfer function:

$$y(t)=\frac{C(z)}{A(z)}e(t)$$

- Zeros are values of $z$ where the transfer function equals zero
- Poles are the inverse of the transfer function's roots (roots of $A(z)$ in case of no cancellations). 

The locations of poles and zeros, particularly within the unit circle in the complex plane, are indicative of system stability. 

-  To compute zeros, set the numerator of the transfer function equal to zero.
-  For poles, set the denominator equal to zero. 

A system is considered asymptotically **stable** if all **poles** lie strictly inside the unit circle, and it is deemed a minimum phase system if both poles and zeros reside within the unit circle.


## Canonical representation of $SSP$

ARMA (and so MA and AR) processes can be represented in various domains:

- **Time domain representation**

$$y(t)=a_1y(t-1)+\cdots a_my(t-m)+ c_o e(t)+\cdots c_ne(t-n)$$


- **Operatorial representation**

$$y(t)=\frac{C(z)}{A(z)}e(t)$$


- **Probabilistic representation**

$$y(t)= m_y,\gamma_y(\tau)$$


- **Frequency domain** 

$$y(t)=m_y,\Gamma_y(\omega)$$


They are all equivalent but not **unique**.
The uniqueness aspect it will be problematic, and so before introducing prediction theory, we need to better understand the non-uniqueness property and find ways to make the representation unique.

Taken the process in operatorial representation:

$$y(t)=\frac{C(z)}{A(z)}e(t)$$


We can adopt this "convention" to be sure about the uniqueness of representation:

1) **monic**: the term with the highest power has coefficient equal to $1$
2) **coprime**: no common factors to that can be simplified
3) have **same degree**
4) have **roots inside the unit circle**

## The spectral factorization theorem

In the analysis of discrete-time signals through the use of the transfer function $W(z)$, if $y(t)=W(z)v(t)$ and: 

- $v(t)$ is stationary
- $W(z)$ is stable 

$y(t)$ is well defined and stationary.

## Final value theorem 

The final value theorem or theorem of the gain is:

$E[y(t)]=W(1) \cdot E[u(t)]$

**NB**:The final value theorem can be applied to $W(z)$ that are not in canonical form.

## All Pass Filter

In the context of transfer functions $W(z)$ and digital filters, an all pass filter is a particular process which transform a white noise in a white noise with a different variance.

An APF is useful for converting a system to canonical form: we can do this by aggregating coefficients and multiplying by a fraction of identical polynomials (so that we essentially multiply by one) and then we redefine a new white noise process. 

Apart the variance everything remains the same; for example if input $u(t)$ and output $y(t)$:
- If $u(t)$ is constant, $y(t)$ is constant.
- If $u(t)$ is sinusoidal, $y(t)$ is sinusoidal.

## Spectral representation


Spectral density of a stationary stochastic process

![](images/Pasted%20image%2020240320164139.png)

$$\Gamma_{y}(w)=\sum_{\tau=-\infty}^{\infty}\gamma_{y}(\tau)\cdot e^{-jw\tau}$$

For a stationary process $y(t)$, $\Gamma_y(\omega)$ is positive, real, even and periodic with period $T = 2\pi$.

Its graph can be represented in the upper half plane of a 2D plot, as the imaginary part is always zero.

The "general rule" regarding the effect of the poles and zeros of the transfer function is that if the generic point $e^{j\omega}$ is:

- Near **zeroes**, the $\Gamma _y (\omega)$ exhibits attenuation. For a zero on the unit circle there is the so called **blocking property** of the transfer function, which refers to the phenomenon where a zero on the unit circle in the z-domain causes the system to completely attenuate that specific frequency component of the input signal. As the frequency moves away from this zero, the attenuation decreases.
- Near **poles**, the $\Gamma _y (\omega)$ is high. The frequency response is amplified. If a pole is near the unit circle, it signifies a strong frequency response at the angle $\omega$ corresponding to the pole's position. 

### Anti-transform formula

The transformation is invertible, and the inverse transform returns the covariance function based on the spectral density, noted as the inverse discrete Fourier transform. 

$$\gamma_{y}(z)=F^{-1}(\Gamma_{y}(\omega))=\frac{1}{2\pi}\int_{-\pi}^{\pi}\Gamma_{y}(\omega) d \omega$$



The spectrum of a $WN$ is constant and equal to its variance:

$$\Gamma_{e}(\omega)==Var[e(t)]=\lambda^{2}$$




## Fundamental theorem of spectral analysis 


Very useful theorem to compute the spectrum:

$$\Gamma_{y}(\omega)=|W(z=e^{j\omega)}|^2*\Gamma_{u}(\omega)$$

Also remember that the spectrum of a $WN(m,\lambda^2)$ is $\lambda^2$. 
It's possible to apply the fundamental theorem of spectrum analysis also if $W(z)$ is not in the canonical form :)

**Recall of useful formulas** for spectrum qualitative study are:

- $e^{j\omega } =\cos \omega +j \sin \omega$
- $e^{-j\omega }=\cos \omega -j\sin \omega$
- $e^{-j\omega}+e^{+j\omega}=2\cos(\omega)$

Remember that is always possible to write the spectral density function as a real-valued function composed by cosine terms easier to interpret.
