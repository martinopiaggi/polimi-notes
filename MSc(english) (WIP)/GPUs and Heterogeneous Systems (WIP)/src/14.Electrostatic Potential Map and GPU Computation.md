# Electrostatic Potential Map and GPU Computation

We are diving into a practical example of computing electrostatic potential maps, which is crucial in molecular dynamics simulations. The goal is to calculate the electric field potential map and the displacement of ions within a molecular system: we'll use direct Coulomb summation.

1. **Parallelizing among atoms**: Each thread computes the contribution of a single atom to the grid points.
2. **Parallelizing for each grid point**: Each thread computes the contribution of all atoms to a single grid point.

Using constant memory without shared memory for the atoms data allows for fast access and reduced memory consumption (since we don't need to write on it). By chunking the atoms data into smaller chunks fitting into constant memory, multiple kernels can compute the contributions of each chunk faster.

So recapping, optimizing a GPU kernel for energy grid computation involves:

- Pre-allocating memory and copying atom data to constant memory.
- Launching the kernel to compute energies for each atom.
- Synchronizing (atomic ops) threads to avoid conflicts when updating grid points.

Two approaches to parallelization:

- **Scatter approach**: Each thread computes the contribution from a single atom.
- **Gather approach**: Each thread computes the contribution for each specific grid point, allowing for spawning more threads and improving load balancing and efficiency. This involves computing contributions on a plane with fixed X and Y coordinates, iterating over the Z coordinates.

Optimizing energy computation involves:

- Using a local register to store `energy` values during computation, writing back to the `energygrid` point at the loop's end to avoid inefficient global memory storage.
- Using a 3D grid where each thread is responsible for one point, with limitations due to the total number of threads that can be spawned.
- Improving arithmetic intensity through thread coarsening, where a single thread computes energy values for multiple nearby points, increasing computation intensity and reducing memory accesses.

### Modifying the Kernel for Coarsened Factor

When processing elements in parallel, the kernel needs to account for the coarsened factor. Adjust the grid of threads, considering the coarsened factor when defining the x-dimension of the grid. The i-index needs adjustment, and each thread index shifts by the coarsened factor.

### Coalesced memory access

Ensuring coalesced memory access by changing how indexes are computed so that consecutive threads access nearby memory locations.

```cpp
//todo
```

These offsets ensure that the threads within the same block write to adjacent memory locations.

### Approximate Solutions: Cutoff Binning

Cutoff binning significantly reduces computational requirements, especially in large-scale computations. It involves dividing the computation into smaller tiles and only considering atoms within a certain radius.

Each grid point needs accurate contributions from nearby atoms, as distant atoms have minimal impact.

Binning may result in different numbers of atoms per bin, requiring all bins to be the same size and aligned for memory coalescing. Maintaining an overflow list ensures that if a bin exceeds capacity, the atom is added to the overflow list. The host executes a sequential cutoff algorithm on the overflow list to complete missing contributions.
