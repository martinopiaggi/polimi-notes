# Frequency Domain

## Transfer functions 

The transfer function $W(z)$, being a ratio of two polynomials, acts as a **digital filter**. It is instrumental in transforming $WN$ into an ARMA process and is applied in analyzing stationary processes through digital filter theory. 

**Shift Operators in Time Domain Analysis**

- Backward shift operator $z^{-1}$  shifts a signal back in time
- Forward shift operator $z$  shifts a signal forward in time.

Properties of $z$ and $z^{-1}$ include linearity, recursive application, and linear composition. Using these properties, we can rewrite an AR model equation in terms of $z$ and $z-1$, revealing the relationship between the operators and the AR model.
The resulting equation shows that the output $y_t$ is the **ratio** of two polynomials of $z$:

$$y(t)=\frac{c_{0}+c_{1}z^{-1}+\cdots c_{n}z^{n}}{1-a_{1}z^{-1}+\cdots a_{m}z^{-m}}e(t)=\frac{C_{(z)}}{A(z)}e(t)=W(z)e^{it}(t)$$


## Asymptotically stability 

Stability analysis involves examining the poles of the transfer function:

$$y(t)=\frac{C(z)}{A(z)}e(t)$$

- Zeros are values of $z$ where the transfer function equals zero
- Poles are the inverse of the transfer function's roots (roots of $A(z)$ in case of no cancellations). 

The locations of poles and zeros, particularly within the unit circle in the complex plane, are indicative of system stability. 

-  To compute zeros, set the numerator of the transfer function equal to zero.
-  For poles, set the denominator equal to zero. 

A system is considered asymptotically **stable** if all **poles** lie strictly inside the unit circle, and it is deemed a minimum phase system if both poles and zeros reside within the unit circle.

The asymptotic stability is often necessary to demonstrate if a process $y(t)=W(z)e(t)$ is stochastic process:

- the process transfer function is asymptotically stable (its poles are all located within the unitary circle) 
- the input (e.g. $e(t)$) is a stationary stochastic process

## Canonical representation of $SSP$

Stationary stochastic processes (so including ARMA, MA and AR) can be equivalently represented in 4 distinct ways, each offering unique insights and applications:

**Probabilistic representation**:

$$y(t)= m_y,\gamma_y(\tau)$$
the mean provides information about the central tendency of the process, while the covariance function captures how data points at different time lags are related: particularly useful for understanding the process's statistical properties and for generating simulations.

**Difference equations** (time domain):

$$y(t)=a_1y(t-1)+\cdots a_my(t-m)+ c_o e(t)+\cdots c_ne(t-n)$$

essential in modeling and forecasting

**Transfer function** (operatorial):

$$y(t)=\frac{C(z)}{A(z)}e(t)$$
Transfer functions are commonly used in control theory and engineering applications, where the focus is on manipulating and controlling the process.

**Frequency** 

$$y(t)=m_y,\Gamma_y(\omega)$$It is especially valuable in applications involving signal processing, where the focus is on understanding the frequency content of the data.



They are all equivalent but not **unique**.
The uniqueness aspect it will be problematic, and so before introducing prediction theory, we need to better understand the non-uniqueness property and find ways to make the representation unique.

Taken the process in operatorial representation:

$$y(t)=\frac{C(z)}{A(z)}e(t)$$


We can adopt this "convention" to be sure about the uniqueness of representation:

1) **monic**: the term with the highest power has coefficient equal to $1$
2) **coprime**: no common factors to that can be simplified
3) have **same degree**
4) have **roots inside the unit circle**

## The spectral factorization theorem

In the analysis of discrete-time signals through the use of the transfer function $W(z)$, if $y(t)=W(z)v(t)$ and: 

- $v(t)$ is stationary
- $W(z)$ is stable 

$y(t)$ is well defined and stationary.

## Final value theorem 

The final value theorem or theorem of the gain is:

$E[y(t)]=W(1) \cdot E[u(t)]$

**NB**: The final value theorem can be applied to $W(z)$ that are not in canonical form.

Final value theorem is useful when we want to define de-biased process:

1. Find mean with gain theorem:
   $$ E[y(t)] = W(1) \cdot \mu = \bar{y} $$

2. Define de-biased processes:
   $$
   \begin{aligned}
   \tilde{y}(t) &= y(t) - \bar{y} \\
   \tilde{e}(t) &= e(t) - \mu
   \end{aligned}
   $$

3. Do whatever you want, like computing the covariance $\gamma_{\tilde{y}}(\tau)=\gamma_{\gamma}(\tau)\quad\forall\tau$


## All Pass Filter

In the context of transfer functions $W(z)$ and digital filters, an all pass filter is a particular process which transform a white noise in a white noise with a different variance.

An APF is useful for converting a system to canonical form: we can do this by aggregating coefficients and multiplying by a fraction of identical polynomials (so that we essentially multiply by one) and then we redefine a new white noise process. 

Apart the variance everything remains the same; for example if input $u(t)$ and output $y(t)$:

- If $u(t)$ is constant, $y(t)$ is constant.
- If $u(t)$ is sinusoidal, $y(t)$ is sinusoidal.

## Spectral representation

Spectral density of a stationary stochastic process

![](images/Pasted%20image%2020240320164139.png)

$$\Gamma_{y}(w)=\sum_{\tau=-\infty}^{\infty}\gamma_{y}(\tau)\cdot e^{-jw\tau}$$

For a stationary process $y(t)$, $\Gamma_y(\omega)$:

- positive
- real
- even $\Gamma(-\omega) = \Gamma(\omega)$ 
- periodic with period $T = 2\pi$.

Its graph can be represented in the upper half plane of a 2D plot, as the imaginary part is always zero.

The "general rule" regarding the effect of the poles and zeros of the transfer function is that if the generic point $e^{j\omega}$ is:

- Near **zeroes**, the $\Gamma _y (\omega)$ exhibits attenuation. For a zero on the unit circle there is the so called **blocking property** of the transfer function, which refers to the phenomenon where a zero on the unit circle in the z-domain causes the system to completely attenuate that specific frequency component of the input signal. As the frequency moves away from this zero, the attenuation decreases.
- Near **poles**, the $\Gamma _y (\omega)$ is high. The frequency response is amplified. If a pole is near the unit circle, it signifies a strong frequency response at the angle $\omega$ corresponding to the pole's position. 

## Spectrum Properties

For stationary processes, the following properties hold for the power spectral density $\Gamma(\omega)$:

1. Scalar Multiple 
   If $y(t) = ax(t)$, then:
   $$
   \Gamma_y(\omega) = a^2 \Gamma_x(\omega)
   $$
2. Sum of Uncorrelated Processes: 
   If $z(t) = x(t) + y(t)$ and $x(t)$ and $y(t)$ are uncorrelated, then:
   $$
   \Gamma_z(\omega) = \Gamma_x(\omega) + \Gamma_y(\omega)
   $$
3. Inverse transform returns the covariance function based on the spectral density, noted as the inverse discrete Fourier transform. 

$$\gamma_{y}(z)=F^{-1}(\Gamma_{y}(\omega))=\frac{1}{2\pi}\int_{-\pi}^{\pi}\Gamma_{y}(\omega) d \omega$$
4. The spectrum of a $WN$ is constant and equal to its variance:

$$\Gamma_{e}(\omega)==Var[e(t)]=\lambda^{2}$$

### Example

If $v(t) = ax(t) - by(t)$ and $x(t)$ and $y(t)$ are uncorrelated, then:
$$\Gamma_v(\omega) = a^2\Gamma_x(\omega) + b^2\Gamma_y(\omega)$$

## Fundamental theorem of spectral analysis 

Very useful theorem to compute the spectrum:

$$\Gamma_y(\omega)=W(z=e^{j\omega})W(z=e^{-j\omega})\Gamma_u(\omega)$$

It's possible to apply the fundamental theorem of spectrum analysis also if $W(z)$ is not in the canonical form :)

**Recall of useful formulas** for spectrum qualitative study are:

- $e^{j\omega } =\cos \omega +j \sin \omega$
- $e^{-j\omega }=\cos \omega -j\sin \omega$
- $e^{-j\omega}+e^{+j\omega}=2\cos(\omega)$

Remember that is always possible to write the spectral density function as a real-valued function composed by cosine terms easier to interpret.
