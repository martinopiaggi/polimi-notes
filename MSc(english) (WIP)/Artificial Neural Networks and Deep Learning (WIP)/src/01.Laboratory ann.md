NumPy stands for Numerical Python and is essential for performing various numerical computations efficiently. NumPy is an open-source library in Python that provides support for large, multi-dimensional arrays and matrices, along with an extensive collection of high-level mathematical functions to operate on these arrays. It is the foundation for most data science and scientific computing tasks in Python and is used extensively by the data science community.

NumPy, short for Numerical Python, is a crucial library in Python for efficient numerical computations. It offers support for extensive arrays and matrices, as well as a range of high-level mathematical functions. This library is open-source and serves as the foundation for data science and scientific computing tasks in Python. It is widely utilized by the data science community.

  

 Key features of NumPy include:

  
  

*   N-dimensional array objects (ndarrays): NumPy provides a powerful array object that can handle data of any dimensionality. Arrays can be of fixed size and can hold elements of the same data type, making them efficient and easy to manipulate.

*   Broadcasting: NumPy enables broadcasting, which allows element-wise operations on arrays of different shapes and sizes, making code concise and readable.

*   Mathematical functions: NumPy offers a vast collection of mathematical functions that operate efficiently on entire arrays without the need for explicit loops.

*   Integration with C/C++ and Fortran: NumPy allows for easy integration with low-level languages like C/C++ and Fortran, enabling faster execution of certain operations.


```python
arr = np.array([[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6], [7, 8, 9]])

  
print("Shape:", arr.shape)  # returns the dimensions of the array (rows, columns)

print("Data Type:", arr.dtype)  # returns the data type of elements in the array

print("Size:", arr.size)  # returns the total number of elements in the array

print("Number of Dimensions:", arr.ndim)  # returns the number of array dimensions
```

```
Shape: (3, 3)
Data Type: int64 
Size: 9 
Number of Dimensions: 2
```


Matrix determinant

```
matrix_determinant = np.linalg.det(matrix_A)

# Creating matrices
matrix_A = np.array([[1, 2], [3, 4]])
matrix_B = np.array([[5, 6], [7, 8]])

  

# Matrix multiplication
matrix_product = np.dot(matrix_A, matrix_B)
print(matrix_product)

[[19 22] 
[43 50]]
```

What is the meaning of one-hot encoding?

One hot encoding is **a technique that we use to represent categorical variables as numerical values in a machine learning model**.

`pandas.get_dummies(_data_, _prefix=None_, _prefix_sep='_'_, _dummy_na=False_, _columns=None_, _sparse=False_, _drop_first=False_, _dtype=None_)`

Convert categorical variable into dummy/indicator variables.

If you don't want the acceleration from a GPU you can have the possibility but remember that you do not leave for thousands of years.



> "The initial objective is to overfit in order to learn from the dataset. You want to overfit at the beginning of your analysis because the idea is that the model must be able to understand the problem first of all. First overfit, then regularize."
