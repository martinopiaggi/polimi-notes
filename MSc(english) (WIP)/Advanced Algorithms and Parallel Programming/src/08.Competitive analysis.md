# Competitive analysis

Difference between online (realtime) and offline algorithms:

- an online algorithm A executes the given operation without any knowledge of the future incoming operations 
- an offline algorithm knows the whole sequence in advance

An online algorithm is $\alpha$-competitive if exists a constant $k$ such that for any incoming sequence of operations $S$ we have that $C_A(S) \le \alpha C_{\text{offline}} + k$  where $C_{\text{offline}}$ is the optimal offline algorithm. 

## Move to front heuristic 

Self-organizing lists. Elements that are accessed frequently will be in front of the list. 
MTF algorithm is $4$-competive with an offline algorithm (that's good).
