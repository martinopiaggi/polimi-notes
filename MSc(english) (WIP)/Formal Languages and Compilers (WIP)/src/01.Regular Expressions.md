# Regular Expressions

The family of **regular languages** *(also called or type $3$)* is the simplest language family.

- Regular expressions can be ambiguous if there are multiple structurally different derivations that result in the same sentence. Sufficient conditions for ambiguity exist.
- Regular expressions can be extended with operators like union, concatenation, and star.
- A language on an alphabet is regular if it can be defined by a regular expression. So only if it is defined by concatenation, union and star over the elementary languages of $L$ ($\{a_1\} , \{a_2\} , \{a_3\} \dots$). 
- Regular expressions have limits, as they cannot represent certain languages, such as those with unbalanced nesting or varying numbers of elements. To represent these languages, **generative grammars** must be used instead.

## Regex 

Regex basics:
- ```x``` the ```x``` character 
- ```.``` any character except newline
- ```[xyz]``` means ```x``` or ```y``` or ```z``` 
- ```[a-z]``` any character between ```a``` and ```z``` 
- ```[^a-z]``` any character except those between ```a``` and ```z```

Said ```R``` a regular expression:
- ```RS``` concatenation of ```R``` and ```S```
- ```R|S``` either ```R``` or ```S``` 
- ```R*``` zero or more occurrences of ```R```
- ```R+``` one or more occurrences of ```R``` 
- ```R?``` zero or one occurrence of ```R ```
- ```R{m,n}``` a number or ```R``` occurrences ranging from ```n``` to ```m ```
- ```R{n,}``` at least n occurrences 
- ```R{n}``` exactly n occurrences of ```R```
