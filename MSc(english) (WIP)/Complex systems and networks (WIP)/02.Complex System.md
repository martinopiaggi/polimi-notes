# Complex Systems

The study of complexity theory is a journey from biology to technology: 

- ant colonies
- starling flocks
- neural activity
- weather phenomena
- synchronization of oscillators
- consensus in sensor networks
- black-out cascades in power networks and in financial networks
- unlimited other applications 
- self-organization of protest movements. 
- Propagation of diseases or ideas or products within social networks 


Complexity theory is based on the idea of "emerging pattern" and draws upon a rich framework: 

- general system theory
- game theory
- cellular automata
- dynamical systems theory
- chaos theory


## Network introduction

A network is represented by a graph with $N$ nodes (or vertices) and $L$ links (or edges).

- **Undirected Networks**: No direction associated with links.
- **Directed Networks**: Links have a specified direction.
- **Weighted Networks**: Links have weights representing the strength or capacity of the connection.


Representation of networks using **adjacency** matrices.
Typically $A$ is a sparse matrix (small density)
$$\rho=\frac{L}{N(N-1)} \text { (dir.) or } \rho=\frac{L}{N(N-1) / 2} \text { (undir.). }$$


Concept of **Graph Degree**: Number of links connected to a node.



A weighted network is described by the $N \times N$ weight matrix $W=\left[w_{i j}\right]$ :
$w_{i j}>0$ if the link $i \rightarrow j$ exists, $w_{i j}=0$ otherwise



The $N \times N$ Laplacian matrix
$$
L=\operatorname{diag}\left(k_1, k_2, \ldots, k_N\right)-A
$$
is an alternative network representation, where:
$$
l_{i i}=k_i, \quad i=1,2, \ldots, N
$$
$l_{i j}=-1$ if the link $i \leftrightarrow j$ exists, $l_{i j}=0$ otherwise $(i \neq j)$

The Laplacian matrix is a key mathematical tool used in the analysis of complex networks. It is derived from the adjacency matrix of a graph and provides valuable insights into the structure and properties of the network. Here are some reasons why the Laplacian matrix is significant:


Typically we can classify components of the graph based on how much they are connected or based on proprierties. For example we can say that a sub-component in the graph as "Strongly connected component" or "Giant out component" or "disconnected components" Or based on "I can reach that components from this component"?

In graph theory, it is common to classify components based on their specific properties or the extent of their connectivity. For instance, we often refer to highly interconnected sub-sections of a graph as "Strongly Connected Components" or "Giant Out Components" indicating intensive links and relations among its nodes. At the same time, certain components might demonstrate no connectivity or weak connections, forming what we describe as "Disconnected Components".
