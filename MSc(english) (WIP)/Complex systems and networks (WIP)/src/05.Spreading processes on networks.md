# Spreading processes on networks

Networked Dynamical Systems involve dynamical systems hosted by each node, with interactions defined by links. 

The collective behaviour of the network is typically more complex than isolated nodes and is influenced by the topological structure of the network. 

## Contagion and epidemics

The spread of infectious diseases, as well as the adoption of products and opinions, can be modeled using probabilistic cellular automata in networked systems.

**Finite State Set**: Each node $i$ is in state $s^i$ at time $t$, belonging to a set $\Sigma$ (e.g., {Susceptible, Infected, Recovered} in epidemics).
- **Local Rules (Contagion Mechanism)**: The state of a node at the next time step depends probabilistically on its current state and the states of its neighbours.

### SIS Process in Networks

The SIS (Susceptible-Infected-Susceptible) model describes the dynamics of disease spread in networks. The process includes two main transitions:

- **Susceptible to Infected (S → I)**: Occurs with probability $\beta I_i\Delta$, where $\beta$ is the infection rate and $I_i$ is the number of infected neighbours.
- **Infected to Susceptible (I → S)**: Occurs with probability $\gamma\Delta$, representing the recovery rate.

The dynamics of epidemics are influenced by the network topology. Homogeneous networks (like Erdös-Rényi networks) and heterogeneous networks (like scale-free networks) exhibit different patterns in disease spread and resilience.


## 


Probabilistic cellular automata are used to model the spread of infectious disea over the network.

Finite state set: node (=individual) $i$ is in state $s^l\in\Sigma=\{1,2,\ldots,\sigma\}$ at time $t$ e.g.:
 $\Sigma=\{Susceptible, Infected, Recovered\}$
 in epidemics

Local rules = contagion mechanism: the next state $s_{t+1}^i$ depends (according to probabilistic rules) on $s_t^i$ and on the state $s_t^j$ of the neighbours


Example: the SIS process at time $t$, each node is

- susceptible(S)=it is healthy but can potentially be infected 
- infected (I) (= it is infected and capable of transmitting the infection)

LOCAL RULES: At each time step (of length $\Delta):$

- **infection**: a node $i$ in state S becomes I with probability $\beta I_i\Delta$, i.e. proportional to the number $I_{i}$ of infected neighbours.
- **recovering**: a node in state I returns **S** with probability $\gamma\Delta$

What is the global behaviour of the epidemics?
How topology of the network impact the spreading of the virus?


An homogeneous network at first approximation can be considered that the degree of each node can be approximated to the average $k$. 



The equations of the SIS (Susceptible-Infected-Susceptible) model are as follows:

- The rate of change of the fraction of infected individuals $y(t)$ in the population is given by:
$$\frac{dy(t)}{dt} = -\gamma y(t) + \beta \langle k \rangle y(t) [1 - y(t)]$$
  where $\gamma$ is the recovery rate, $\beta$ is the transmission rate, and $\langle k \rangle$ is the average number of neighbors.

- The model reaches a non-trivial ($>0$) asymptotically stable equilibrium given by:
$$y = \frac{-1}{\gamma/\beta \langle k \rangle}$$
  This equilibrium exists if and only if ($\beta/\gamma > \langle k \rangle$).

- The epidemic threshold ($\beta_c$) is defined as:
  $$\beta_c = \frac{\gamma}{\langle k \rangle}$$

These equations describe the dynamics of disease spread in a network where individuals can be in one of two states: susceptible or infected. After recovery, individuals return to the susceptible state, allowing for the possibility of reinfection.

In summary, $\beta$ measures how easily the disease spreads (higher $\beta$ means more contagious disease), while $\gamma$ measures how quickly individuals recover from the disease (higher $\gamma$ means faster recovery). The balance of these two parameters influences the overall dynamics of the disease spread in a population.

1. **Transition from Susceptible to Infected (S → I)**:
  $$S \rightarrow I \text{ with probability } \beta \Delta \times I$$
   Here, $\beta$ represents the infection rate or transmission probability, and$ I$ is the number of infected neighbors. $\Delta$ is a small time interval. The probability of a susceptible individual becoming infected in this interval is proportional to the number of their infected neighbors and the infection rate.

2. **Transition from Infected to Susceptible (I → S)**:
  $ $ I \rightarrow S \text{ with probability } \gamma \Delta$ $ 
   In this case, $\gamma$ is the recovery rate, representing the likelihood of an infected individual recovering and moving back to the susceptible state over a time interval $\Delta$ .







homogeneous (or almost homogeneous)

In a network:

- if $\beta\leq\frac\gamma{<k>}\Longrightarrow$ the fraction $y(t)$ of infected tends to $O$(=the epidemic dies out)
- if $\beta>\frac\gamma{<k>}$ $\Longrightarrow$ the fraction $y$ of infected increases with the transmission rate $\beta$

This result is consistent with the classical epidemiology (Kermack and McKendrick, 1927):


$\gamma$ is a biological parameter. This means that exists a epidemic threshold.
No epidemic can survive if the transmission rate is below the epidemic threshold.

Our parameters are basically $\beta$ and $<k>$ (lockdown). 


In a heterogeneous (for example scale-free) network
(Pastor-Satorras and Vespignani, 2001):

- the epidemic threshold is $\beta_c=\gamma<k>/<k^2>$, then it may tend to $0$ for large networks $(N\to\infty)$ 


$\gamma(t)$ never vanishes, whatever the value of the transmission rate $\beta$ 


the nodes with larger degree are rare but have a larger degree large probability of being infected


Presence of hubs in a scale-free network is crucial for the epidemic. 


How can we model the epidemic dynamics when the network is strongly inhomogeneous? 
We have a system of differential equations

We must model $y$ separately for each ensemble of nodes having the same degree $k$ .

$$
\gamma_{k}\left(t\right)=-\gamma y_{k}(t)+\beta\Theta_{k}(t)(1-\gamma_{k}(t))\:,\:k=k_{\operatorname*{min}},\ldots,k_{\operatorname*{max}}
$$

$\Theta_{k}(t)=(n.ofneighbors\times prob.thata neighbor is I)= k\stackrel{\sim}{j}(t)=k(\sum_hhP(h)y_h(t))/<k>.$

$At\:the\:equilibrium\:(\dot{y}_k=0)$ 
 we obtain

Thus the prevalence $\gamma_k$ grows with $k$ and tends to $1ask\to\infty$ (=nodes with a very large number of connections are rare but, most likely, they are infected).

The (global) prevalence is given by

$$
y(t)=\Sigma_{k}P(k)y_{k}(t)
$$

Immunization of homogeneous/heterogeneous networks immunization $=$ vaccination policy aimed at eradicating the epidemic $(y\to0)$ = fraction of vaccinated nodes

 If nodes to be vaccinates are selected at random: $g=$ prob. that a randomly chosen susceptible is

$$
\beta\big(1-y(t)\big)\implies\beta(1-g)\big(1-y(t)\big)
$$

which is equivalent to replace $\beta$ —》 $\beta(1-g).$


With the immunization we are able to eradicating the epidemic $y \rightarrow 0$ and also we can define the threshold of number of people we need to vaccinate to eradicate the population: What is the vaccination fraction $g_c$ above which the epidemic is eradicated?


Homogeneous networks (random vaccination)
no epidemic below the threshold $\beta<\beta_{c}=\frac{\gamma}{<k>}\quad\Longrightarrow\quad\beta(1-g)<\frac{\gamma}{<k>}$

$$
g>g_{c}=1-\frac{\gamma}{\beta<k>}
$$

If $g>g_c$ nodes are vaccinated at random, the epidemic is eradicated $(y\to0)$.

Heterogeneous networks (random vaccination)
no epidemic below the threshold $\beta<\beta_{c}=\frac{\gamma<k>}{<k^{2}>}\quad\Longrightarrow\quad\beta(1-g)<\frac{\gamma<k>}{<k^{2}>}$

$$
g>g_{c}=1-\frac{\gamma<k>}{\beta<k^{2}>}
$$

If $<k^2>\to\infty$ (scale-free nets with large $N)$ then $g_c\to1;$ need to vaccinate al population.

This is coherent with the previous "Pastor-Satorras 2001" results. 

But this is random vaccination, with a targeted vaccination, like a "target attacks" on the network. (Obviously starting with the one with highest degree). 

Problem: how to identify the network (then the hubs) in a real-world population?


# Epidemics on networks


Example: the SIS process At time $t$, each node is

susceptible $( S) ( = $itishealthybutcanpotentiallybeinfected$) $,on infected (I) (= it is infected and capable of transmitting the infection)

LOCAL RULES: At each time step (of length $\Delta):$

infection: a node $i$ in state S becomes I with probability $\beta I_i\Delta$, i.e. proportional to the number $I_i$ of infected neighbors

recovering: a node in state I returns S with probability $\gamma\Delta$

In the context of the SIS model applied to networks, the properties differ between Erdös-Rényi and scale-free networks:

1. **Erdös-Rényi Networks**:
   - These networks are characterized by a Poisson degree distribution.
   - The asymptotically stable equilibrium of the fraction of infected individuals $y$ is non-trivial (greater than zero) if:
     $$ \frac{\beta}{\gamma} > \frac{\langle k \rangle}{k} $$
     Here, $ \beta $ is the infection rate, $ \gamma $ is the recovery rate, and $ \langle k \rangle $ is the average degree.
   - The epidemic threshold is given by:
     $$ \beta_c = \frac{\gamma}{\langle k \rangle} $$
   - Below this threshold, the disease dies out, while above it, the disease can persist in the population.

2. **Scale-Free Networks**:
   - These networks are characterized by a power-law degree distribution, implying a significant number of highly connected nodes (hubs).
   - The epidemic threshold for scale-free networks is:
     $$ \beta_c = \frac{\gamma \langle k \rangle}{\langle k^2 \rangle} $$
   - In large scale-free networks, this threshold $\beta_c$ may tend towards zero, indicating that even a very low infection rate can sustain the epidemic.
   - Regardless of the value of the transmission rate $\beta$, the fraction of infected individuals $y(t)$ never completely vanishes.
   - Nodes with a larger degree, though rare, have a higher probability of being infecte.

These differences are crucial in understanding disease dynamics on networks. In Erdös-Rényi networks, an epidemic threshold exists above which the disease can spread, while in scale-free networks, even low rates of transmission can sustain an epidemic due to the presence of hubs.

# Consensus in Networked Multi-Agent Systems


Consensus in networked multi-agent systems involves reaching an agreement among agents, with each agent represented as a node in the network. The critical question is whether consensus can be achieved with only partial information exchange.

- **Undirected Networks**: If connected, consensus is reached, and the value is the arithmetic average of all initial states.
- **Directed Networks**: Consensus depends on strong connectivity, with the consensus value being a weighted average based on the network's topology.



The Laplacian matrix plays a crucial role in consensus dynamics, particularly in its eigenvalues and eigenvectors, which influence the rate and feasibility of reaching consensus.


Both for analysis and project problems (I want to study consensus or I want to engineer consensus)

CONSENSUS Given a set of agents (=dynamical systems):
 Bass o "consensus" means to reach an agreement regarding a certain quantity of interest, that depends on the state of all agents;
algorithm" (or protocol) is the interaction rule that specifies the consensus information exchange between agent.

Agents are connected through a network **communication only with neighbors**
Each node $i=1,2,...,N$ hosts a system $\dot{x}_{i}(t)=f(x_{i}(t),u_{i}(t))$, continuous-time model
 $x_i(t+1)=f(x_i(t),u_i(t))$, discrete-time model

$u_i(t)$ = $input$ = interaction with other systems


Consensus between undistinguishable agents 


Consensus is:

$$x_1=x_2=\cdots=x_N\mathrm{~for~}t\to\infty $$
Constrained consensus if you specify consensus on a **specific value**. 


The critical question here is :

> "Can consensus be reached with partial exchange of information only (=local, distributed, decentralized)?"


The typical example here is "integrator":

A graph of nodes where each node integrates the input. 


Derivate of $\dot x(t)$ is equal to the $u(t)$ which means that you are integrating the function over time. 
This is the local dynamic. It's the simplest one. 




Consensus in a network of $N$ integrator agents Each node hosts the "simplest" linear system: $\dot{x}_{i}(t)=u_{i}(t),\quad i=1,2,...,N,\quad x_{i}$ scalar.

In the context of consensus analysis and engineering in multi-agent systems, the fundamental concept of "consensus" refers to the process where a group of agents, which are dynamical systems, agree upon a certain quantity of interest. This quantity is determined based on the state of all agents. To facilitate this process, an "algorithm" or "protocol" is employed, defining the rules for information exchange and interactions among agents.

When designing and analyzing consensus phenomena in multi-agent systems, it is crucial to consider that agents are interconnected through a communication network and can only exchange information with their immediate neighbors. Each agent, represented as a node in a network, follows a specific model: a continuous-time model $\dot{x}_{i}(t)=f(x_{i}(t),u_{i}(t))$ or a discrete-time model $x_i(t+1)=f(x_i(t),u_i(t))$, where $u_i(t)$ represents the interaction input with other systems.

The goal of consensus is to ensure that all agents (nodes) reach the same state over time, formally expressed as $x_1=x_2=\cdots=x_N\mathrm{~~for~~}t\to\infty$. This can also be constrained to achieving consensus on a specific value.

A critical aspect of consensus in these systems is determining whether it can be reached with only partial (local, distributed, decentralized) exchange of information. A typical example of such a system is the "integrator," where each node in the graph integrates input over time. The simplest local dynamic in this context is represented by a network of $N$ integrator agents, each hosting a linear system $\dot{x}_{i}(t)=u_{i}(t)$.

In an undirected and connected network, the interaction between nodes is "diffusive," meaning it is proportional to the state unbalance between each node and its neighbors. The dynamics of each node are given by:

$$\dot{x_i}(t)=u_i(t)=\sum_{j\in V_i}\left(x_j(t)-x_i(t)\right)$$

Here, $L=diag(k_1,k_2,...,k_N)-A$ represents the $N\times N$ Laplacian matrix of the network, influencing the collective dynamics of the system, denoted by $x=[x_1\quad x_2\quad...\quad x_N]^T$. Notably, these collective dynamics are dependent on the graph topology.

In the Laplacian matrix $L:$ 

- The diagonal elements $L_{ii}$ represent the degree of node $i$.
- The off-diagonal elements $L_{ij}$ (where $i\neq j$) are the negative of the
 adjacency matrix elements, typically -1 if nodes $i$ and $j$ are connected, and $0$ otherwise.


The Laplacian matrix has several important properties:

1. Row sums and column sums are zero, reflecting the principle of conservation of flow in the network.
2. It is symmetric for undirected graphs.
3. It is semi-positive definite.
4. The smallest eigenvalue is 0, and the corresponding eigenvector is a constant vector (due to the row sum property).

In the context of consensus, the Laplacian matrix is fundamental because its properties determine how quickly and effectively a consensus can be reached in the network. The eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the Laplacian, in particular, provide insights into the network's connectivity and the speed of convergence to consensus.


In principle, infinite consensus states but only one is possible which depends on the graph topology. 


Since $\Sigma_i\dot{x}_i=0$, it turns out that $\Sigma_i\chi_i(t)=\sum_i\chi_i(0)=C$ (constant). Thus the only feasible equilibrium $\bar{x}$ has

$$ \bar{x}_{1}=\bar{x}_{2}=\cdots=\bar{x}_{N}=(1/N)\sum_{i}x_{i}(0) $$

$\lambda_{1}=0$ governs the (trivial) dynamics along the eigenvector $[1,1,...,1]^{\mathrm{T}}.$ 


**Conservation of the Sum of States**: The equation $\Sigma_i\dot{x}_i=0$ suggests that the sum of the rate of change of states over all nodes in the network is zero. This implies conservation in the system – the total "quantity" represented by the states $x_i$​ of the nodes doesn't increase or decrease over time; it's merely redistributed among the nodes.


Given the conservation of the total state, the only feasible equilibrium state $\overline{x}$ for all nodes, where equilibrium means no node's state is changing anymore (i.e., consensus is reached), is the average of all the initial states. Mathematically, this is expressed as:

$$ \bar{x}_{1}=\bar{x}_{2}=\cdots=\bar{x}_{N}=(1/N)\sum_{i}x_{i}(0) $$
This equation states that each node's final state (at consensus) will be the average of all nodes' initial states.

the eigenvector $[1,1,...,1]^{\mathrm{T}}.$  This eigenvector represents the state where all nodes have the same value, which is the essence of consensus. The zero eigenvalue governs this "trivial" dynamics, meaning it's associated with the unchanging, conserved aspect of the system where all nodes are in agreement. The dynamics are "trivial" in the sense that no complex evolution of the system is happening once this state is reached – all nodes simply hold the same value.
    

In summary, this explanation emphasizes that in a network operating under a consensus protocol, the final state where all nodes agree is predetermined by the initial conditions and the structure of the network. The system conserves the total sum of all individual states, leading to an equilibrium where each node ends up at the average of all initial states.

In network theory, the behavior of consensus differs significantly between undirected and directed networks, and this is reflected in the way consensus values are reached.


**Undirected Network**: In an undirected network, if the network is connected, consensus is inevitably reached. The value of this consensus is the arithmetic mean of all initial states of the nodes in the network. This implies that the network's structure allows for an equal distribution and sharing of information among all nodes, leading to a uniform consensus state where every node agrees on the average of all initial states.


Directed Network: The scenario in directed networks is more complex. Consensus is still achievable, but it depends on the network's connectivity. A
 key pointis the consideration of the Laplacian matrix with $k_{out}$, where $k_{out}$
 represents the out-degree of the nodes. Consensus in a directed network is only guaranteed if the network is strongly connected, meaning information can freely spread throughout the entire network. In a more colloquial sensey "obviously, information must be able to disseminate across the whole
We found out that there is a consensus value which is weighted average network."
 In a directed network, a consensus value is a weighted average of the initial
 states. This is mathematically represented as:

$$
x=\sum_iw_ix_i(0)
$$

where $\sum_iw_i=1$.Here, $w_i$ are weights that depend on the network topology, and $\alpha$ is the weighted average. These weights $[w_1,w_2,...,w_N]$
 are actually the components of a left eigenvector of the Laplacian matrix $L_{4}$ corresponding to the eigenvalue $\lambda_1=0.$ The Laplacian matrix for directed networks is defined as $L_{ii}=k_i^{out}$ and $L_{ij}=-\alpha_{ij}$ for $i\neq j.$

 An important condition for convergence to the average initial state is when the network is balanced, meaning each node's in-degree $k_i^{in}$ is equal to its out-degree $k_i^{out}$ .In such cases, $\alpha$ becomes the average of the initial states, expressed as:

$$
\alpha=\left(\frac1N\sum_ix_i(0)\right)
$$
 
 Finally, the speed at which a network reaches consensus is dominated by the first sub-dominant eigenvalue of $L_S=(L+L^T)/2$,where $L^\mathrm{T}$ is the transpose of the Laplacian matrix. This eigenvalue gives an indication of how quickly the consensus state will be achieved in the network.

Possible extensions:

- different forms of the coupling function $u_i = h(x)$
- network design for optimizing consensus performance
- other (less trivial) agent models (linear or nonlinear)
- time-varying network topology (e.g., mobile agents) (think about AI agents/robots which are moving and have a limited range to communicate information )
- consensus on oscillatory behavior: synchronization
