# Network models 

We continue our in-depth exploration of the structural properties of networks, delving into a new chapter titled "Network Models." These models represent algorithms that generate networks with particular properties, aiming to emulate the formation processes of real-world networks. The literature presents a multitude of such models, each offering unique perspectives.

## Random (Erdos-Renyi) networks 

Erdös-Rényi Networks:
- In this model, a network is formed by connecting L randomly extracted pairs of N nodes, resulting in an average degree $\langle k\rangle=2 L / N$ . The degree distribution in these networks is Poisson-distributed for large $\mathrm{N}$ , with a typical scale of node degree $k_i=\langle k\rangle$ .
- An alternative Erdös-Rényi model involves starting from a graph with $\mathrm{N}$ nodes and no links, then connecting each pair of nodes with a given probability $p$ . The resulting degree distribution is binomial.
- Key properties include a giant component emerging when $\langle k\rangle>1$ , an average distance that grows logarithmically with $\mathrm{N}$ (indicating a small-world effect), and a clustering coefficient that tends to zero as $\mathrm{N}$ increases.

Two alternatives procedure:

1.$G(N,L)$ :
	- For large$ N$ , the degree is Poisson-distributed with $\langle k \rangle \approx \frac{2L}{N}$ .
	- The "typical" scale of node degree is$ k \approx \langle k \rangle$ .
	- Node degrees have small fluctuations around $\langle k \rangle$ .
	- The network is "almost homogeneous".
2.$G(N,p)$ :
	- Start from a graph with $N$ nodes and no links.
	- Connect each pair$i, j$ with a given probability $p$ .
	- The degree distribution is binomial: $P(k) = \binom{N-1}{k} p^k (1-p)^{(N-1-k)}$ where the binomial coefficient is defined as $\binom{N-1}{k} = \frac{(N-1)!}{k!(N-1-k)!}$ 
	- resulting with $\langle k \rangle = p (N-1)$ 


## Scale-free (Barabasi-Albert) networks

Scale-free networks, such as those formed by the Barabási-Albert algorithm, are characterized by a few key properties:

1. **Preferential Attachment**: New nodes are added to the network one at a time and are more likely to connect to nodes that already have a high degree. This is known as preferential attachment.

2. **Hubs**: The network contains a few very connected nodes, known as hubs, and many nodes with fewer connections.

3. **Power-Law Degree Distribution**: The degree distribution of the network follows a power-law function, $P(k) \approx k^{-\alpha}$, where $k$ is the degree of a node and $\alpha$ is a constant. This implies that there are a few nodes with a very high degree and many nodes with a low degree.

4. **Heterogeneity**: Due to the power-law degree distribution, node degrees have large fluctuations around the average degree $\langle k \rangle$, and there is no typical scale of node degree. This results in a network that is strongly heterogeneous.



The Barabási-Albert (BA) model is a method for creating scale-free networks using a preferential attachment mechanism. The procedure of building a network according to the BA model involves the following steps:

1. **Initial Network**: Start with a small number ($ m_0$ ) of nodes.

2. **Addition of New Nodes**: At each time step, add a new node with$ m$ ($\le m_0$ ) edges that link the new node to$ m$ different nodes already present in the network.

3. **Preferential Attachment**: The probability that a new node will be connected to node$ i$ depends on the degree of node$ i$ , such that nodes with higher degrees have a higher probability of being selected. This probability can be expressed as $\text{Prob}(i) = \frac{k_i}{\sum_j k_j}$ , where$ k_i$ is the degree of node$ i$ and the sum in the denominator runs over all pre-existing nodes.

4. **Network Growth**: Repeat step 2 until the network reaches the desired size.

This model generates networks with a power-law degree distribution, characteristic of "scale-free" networks, where a few nodes (hubs) have very high connectivity, while most nodes have relatively few links. This property is observed in many real-world networks, such as the Internet, social networks, and biological networks.


A scale-free network is a type of network characterized by a power-law degree distribution. This means that the probability \( P(k) \) that a randomly selected node has \( k \) connections (or degree \( k \)) follows the form \( P(k) \sim k^{-\gamma} \), where \( \gamma \) is a constant typically in the range \( 2 < \gamma < 3 \). Key features of scale-free networks include:

1. **Heterogeneity**: Unlike random networks, where nodes typically have a similar number of connections, scale-free networks have a few highly connected nodes (hubs) and many nodes with fewer connections.

2. **Robustness**: Scale-free networks are generally robust to random failures but vulnerable to targeted attacks, especially on the hubs.

3. **Emergence through Growth and Preferential Attachment**: These networks often emerge in systems that grow over time, where new nodes prefer to attach to already highly connected nodes. This is known as the Barabási-Albert model, a classic model for generating scale-free networks.

4. **Ubiquity**: Scale-free networks are found in various domains, including biological systems (e.g., metabolic and protein interaction networks), technological systems (e.g., the Internet, airline routes), and social networks (e.g., collaboration networks).

The concept of scale-free comes from the fact that there is no typical node degree that dominates the network, and the degree distribution lacks a characteristic scale. This contrasts with networks like regular lattices or random networks, which have a characteristic scale related to the average degree of the nodes.




Scale-Free (Barabási-Albert) Networks:
- These networks are generated by adding one node at a time, connecting it preferentially to nodes with higher degrees. This "preferential attachment" results in a network with few highly connected nodes ("hubs") and many scarcely connected nodes. "Rich gets richer" 
- The Barabási-Albert algorithm, inspired by the growth of the World Wide Web, starts with an arbitrary number of connected nodes$ (\mathrm{mO})$ and grows by adding new nodes, each with a number of links$ (\mathrm{m} \leq \mathrm{m} 0$ ) that connect preferentially to existing nodes with high degrees.
- In large networks, the degree distribution follows a power-law function$ P(k) \approx k^{-\alpha}$ , and the network exhibits a small-world effect with the average distance tending to grow logarithmically. The clustering coefficient in such networks tends to zero.

Is it true that in a lot of real network I find a degree distribution which is a power-law function. 

Examples where all have scale-free property but only the first two are power-law (approximal with a line). The third one seems something hybrid where at some point there is a change of pendency of a line. The forth one is something that still is scale-free but there is a more complex structure and there isn't the power-law property.

Simple, regular networks are a basic form, where each node consistently has the same number of connections. However, real networks often evolve spontaneously, rarely exhibiting such uniform structure. A fundamental model to study is the Erdos-Renyi network, also known as random or casual networks. This model serves as a baseline for comparison, helping to identify significant deviations in specific networks.

In the Erdos-Renyi model, we define the number of nodes and randomly establish links between them. For large $\mathrm{N}$ , the degree is Poisson-distributed with $\langle k\rangle=2 L / N$ , where $\mathrm{L}$ is the number of links and $\mathrm{N}$ is the number of nodes. The network has a giant component if $\langle k\rangle>1$ , and the average distance grows slowly with $\mathrm{N}$ , exhibiting a "small-world" effect. As $\mathrm{N}$ grows, the clustering coefficient tends towards zero, indicating large networks have vanishing clustering.

An alternative model involves assigning a random probability to each potential link between nodes. This approach, too, results in networks with specific properties, where the occurrence of links is a stochastic process. The Erdos-Renyi model highlights the concept of a reference network, against which others can be compared.


Another influential model is the Barabasi-Albert algorithm, introduced by Reika Albert and her collaborator in 2000 . This model creates networks by adding nodes one at a time, each with a predefined number of links. The key feature of this model is "preferential attachment," where nodes with more connections are more likely to gain new ones, embodying the "rich get richer" phenomenon. This leads to a power-law distribution in the network's connectivity. The network contains few very connected nodes ("hubs") and many scarcely connected nodes. For large $\mathrm{N}$ , the degree distribution follows a power-law function$ P(k) \approx k^{-\alpha}$ . The network is strongly heterogeneous, and as it grows, its properties, like average distance and clustering coefficient, exhibit specific trends.

The course also explores the concept of scale-free networks, characterized by a power-law degree distribution. These networks are studied for their structural properties and real-world applications, such as understanding the spread of diseases in social networks. Notably, the World Wide Web is an example of a scale-free network, where anyone can contribute to its growth.

Finally, the course delves into the statistical and mathematical foundations underlying these network models, including differential equations and probabilistic distributions. By understanding these models, we can better comprehend the complex structures of real-world networks and their implications.


Barabási-Albert algorithm inspired by the WWW growth
WWW is a perfect example of a "growth free" network where there is an emergent phenomen 
self-organized. 

 
Then for$ N \rightarrow \infty$ :
- the average degree tends to $\langle k\rangle=2 m$ and the **degree distribution** to the power-law$ P(k) \approx k^{-3}$ 

How to compute$ k^{-3}$ ? the degree distribution (the "continuum approach"):
- After$ t$ steps, the network has$ m_0+t$ nodes and $\cong m t$ links.
- At each step$ t$ , the prob. for node$ i$ to be selected by one of new links is$ k_i / \sum_j k_j$ .
- Approximating the degree$ k_i$ with a continuous variable, its increase rate is
$$ 
\frac{d k_i}{d t}=m \frac{k_i}{\sum_j k_j}=\frac{k_i}{2 t}
$$ 
because $\left(\sum_j k_j\right) / 2=m t$ is the number of links.
- Solving the differential equation for a node inserted at time$ t_i$ with$ k_i\left(t_i\right)=m$ :
$$ 
k_i(t)=m\left(\frac{t}{t_i}\right)^{0.5}
$$ 

It's interesting to note the importance of$ t$ here. "Rich get richer" effect ... the older is the node the more is "naturally advantageous" .  


Based on continuum approach (what is continuum approach?) 



- $\left\langle k^2 \right\rangle$ and thus the variance $\sigma^2=\left\langle k^2>-<k\right\rangle^2$ diverge$ (P(k)$ has a "heavy tail")
- the average distance tends to$ d \approx \log N / \log \log N$ ("small-world" effect)
- the clustering coefficient$ C$ vanishes as$ C \approx$$ (\log N)^2 / N \rightarrow 0$ 


Two (of the many) generalizations of the Barabasi-Albert algorithm:

Dorogovtsev-Mendes-Samukhin (DMS) model, to get a power law degree distribution$ P(k) \approx k^{-\gamma}$ with arbitrary $\gamma \in(2, \infty)$ .

Modifies the preferential attachment probability that a link of the new node$ i$ connects to the existing node$ j$ 
$$ 
\text { from } \frac{k_j}{\sum_h k_h} \quad \text { to } \frac{k_j+k_0}{\sum_h\left(k_h+k_0\right)}
$$ 



By choosing a value$ k_0 \in(-m, \infty)$ , it is proved that $\gamma=3+k_0 / m$  <- This variant make possible to modulate the degree distribution using$ k_0$ . This is useful to modelling real networks. 


Holme-Kim (HK) model, to get a non-vanishing (large) clustering coefficient$ C$ .


Forces the creation of triangles by alternating (in a probabilistic fashion) preferential attachment steps and triad formation steps.



## Small World problem (Watts-Strogatz) networks 


What is the crucial aspect/fact which makes "small world" property?




In typical real-world networks, the average distance$ d=\left\langle d_{i j}\right\rangle$ turns out to be surprisingly small.

Empirically, it is observed that$ d$ increases "slowly" with$ N$ ("small-world" effect).




Watts and Strogatz (1998) demonstrated that adding a few long-distance connections to a regular network yields a dramatic decrease of$ d$ .




The ring is pathological 

Start from a regular "ring" graph with$ N$ nodes, where each node is connected to the$ m$ right neighbors and to the$ m$ left-neighbors (=each node has exactly degree$ 2 m$ ).
The network has large clustering coefficient (typical of "regular" networks)
$$ 
C=\frac{3 m-3}{4 m-2}
$$ 
and the average distance is also large (grows linearly with$ N$ )
$$ 
d=\frac{N}{4 m}
$$ 




"Rewiring": Scan all nodes$ i=1,2, \ldots, N$ . Consider all the links$ i \leftrightarrow j$ connecting$ i$ to its right neighbors and, with probability$ p$ , break the connection to$ j$ and redirect it to a randomly selected node.
If$ p$ is small, the local properties are not significantly modified:
- the degree distribution remains concentrated around the average degree (unchanged!) $\langle k\rangle=2 m$ 
- the clustering coefficient$ C$ does not vary significantly
But the birth of few, "long distance" connections is sufficient to yield a dramatic decrease of the average distance, which passes from$ d \approx N$ to
$$ 
d \approx \log N
$$ 


The idea of "6 degree" is very popular and typically indicates that between a person and another person there are exactly 6 people. 


Why Erdos-Rényi ? 

Stochastic block-model 

Syntethic models are a lot and this model is a sort of generalization to build a network based on the concept of "group" or membership. Based on the concept of groups we can define the probability of connecting two nodes (or two groups). 

It is a "block" generalization of Erdös-Rényi networks.

The model is completely defined by:
- the number of nodes$ N$ and the number of groups (blocks)$ B$ 
- a partition of the nodes, i.e., the group membership$ b_i$ of each node$ i$ 
- the probabilities$ p_{r s}=p_{s r}$ that a node in group$ r$ is linked to a node in group$ s$ (including$ r=s$ )


We can then (based on probabilities on connecting nodes between different groups (or the same group) define a matrix adjacency.

It is a general, versatile model for large-scale networks, suitable to parameter identification via statistical inference techniques. 

Examples: 

- Random 
- Modular 
- Core-periphery: example the idea of public transportation where it's easy to move from periphery to the core but not between periphery to the periphery
