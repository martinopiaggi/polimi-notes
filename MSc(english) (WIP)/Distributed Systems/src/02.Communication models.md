# Communication models

## Middleware

Middleware as a protocol layer is adopted to raise the level of abstraction of communication. Middleware main function is to provide the (un)marshaling of data: 

- naming protocols
- security protocols
- scaling mechanisms (such as replication and caching)

Actually the middleware can assume different roles depending on the architecture paradigm: for example in a event based architecture the middleware acts as the event dispatcher, collecting subscriptions and routing event notifications based on these subscriptions. Other possibilieties are: 

- Middleware as service broker in a SOA
- Middleware as registry (for naming) in RMI 

Middleware can offer different forms of communication:

- Transient/persistent communication
- synchronous/asynchronous communication

Popular combination are:

- transient communication with synchronization after processing
- Persistent communication with synchronization at the request submission.

## Remote procedure call 

The ***Interface Definition Language*** (IDL) abstractly describes a function's interface, separating it from its implementation. IDL is important when we talk about **Remote Procedure Call (RPC)**, which is a protocol that one program can use to request a service (function) from a program located in another computer on a network without having to understand the network's details. 
RPC it's based on a sort of middleware which from signature creates the code to manage all the transport and remote decoding stuff:

- serialization
- marshalling: hosts may use different data representations (e.g., little endians vs. big endians) and proper conversions are needed. For example a data structure representation or even a integer can be completely different from source/destination machine.

Variants of RPC: 

- **Lightweight RPC** is a variant of RPC designed for local environments with fewer threads and processes. It eliminates the need to listen on a channel. Instead of actual packets, it utilizes shared memory to serialize and share data between processes. The receiving process waits for the data to become available in the shared memory, processes it, and returns the result. This approach is more efficient and eliminates resource waste compared to traditional RPC.
- **Asynchronous RPC** has several variations with different semantics. 
- Some frameworks also support **batched** and **queued** **RPC**. 

The main challenge of RPC is binding the client to the server, which involves determining the location of the server process and establishing communication with it.

### Examples RPC

- **Sun's solution**: daemon process that bind calls and server ports. It solves only the second problem, since the clients must know in advance where the service resides. Sun RPC includes the ability to perform batched RPC. 
- **DCE's solution**: Sun's solution but with a directory server to allow us to fully decoupled client-server such that the client has to known only the address of the directory service, goes to the directory service, list the set of functions that are available, search for the function that it must bind this happens at the binding time.

### RMI: Remote method invocation

RMI (Remote Method Invocation) is the natural extension to RPC: same thing but OOP. 

> "Actually, under the hood, there is a big difference to copy just data structures and objects which have methods!" 

In RMI, there is a natural separation between the interface and implementation of an object. This distinction not only exists logically but also physically, as the object's implementation resides on a remote machine. This setup provides the illusion of referencing a remote object as if it were local, simplifying the interaction between objects located in different locations.

The use of a proxy **enables passing objects by reference** in RMI. This proxy serves as a representation of the remote object and allows the client to invoke methods on the remote object as if it were a local object.
In RMI it is not feasible to pass objects by copying due to the presence of **methods** in the objects. For example, in a multilingual environment would be necessary to translate the methods code while copying the object (impractical task). Therefore, RMI's approach of passing objects **by reference** using a proxy is a more effective solution.

### Passing parameters approaches 

Parameters are embedded in the request and can be passed in three ways:

- **By value** (or **by copy**): A copy of the parameter's value is created and passed to the function. Changes made to the parameter within the function don't affect the original value (like in C when passing data types).
- **By reference**: The memory address of the parameter is passed to the function, allowing direct access and modification of the original value. This is impossible in DS since they don't share a common memory.
- **By copy/restore**: a copy of the original parameter is created and passed (like in *by value* approach) but the changes made to the parameter after the call are saved in the "original variable": this produce apparently the same effect as "by reference". 

|              | By Copy                       | By Copy/Restore                       | By Reference                                     |
|---------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **RPC**          | Easy (data structures accessible)          | Easy (data structures accessible)              | Impossible                                     |
| **RMI**          | Exception: Java RMI (due to JVM for Java <-> Java) | Impossible                         | Easy (proxy of the object)                              |

## Message oriented communication

RPC/ RMI you use invocations of methods and there is full synchronization whereas MOC is based on message and it is typically **asynchronous**.
Possible models of message-oriented communication are message passing, message queuing and publish/subscribe. Each of these models offers different ways of managing and sending **messages** within a system.

### Message passing

Message passing is a common form of message-oriented communication. We can distinguish these 4 main approaches to message passing: 

- **Stream sockets**: the server accepts connection on a port, the clients connect to the server (TCP: connection oriented)
- **Datagram sockets**: both client and server create a socket bound to a port and use it to send and receive datagrams (built on UDP)
- **Multicast sockets**: IP multicast is a protocol used to transmit UDP datagrams to multiple recipients simultaneously. 
- **[MPI](../../Advanced%20Algorithms%20and%20Parallel%20Programming/src/13.MPI.md)**: an higher level version of sockets designed explicitly for clusters of machines. Still low-level and very lightweight. 

### Message queuing 

A much higher level than sockets, point-to-point, persistent (first form of **persistent** communication that we encounter in this course) message oriented communication model. 
Main features: 

- Messages are sent to queues to a **server's queue**.
- The server **asynchronously** retrieves the requests from the queue, processes them, and returns the results to the client's queue.
- Queues are identified by symbolic names, eliminating the need for a lookup service.
- Queue managers act as relays to manipulate the queues.
- Main idea is to promote **decoupling**: thanks to persistency and asynchronicity, clients need not remain connected
- Queue sharing simplifies **load balancing**

### Publish-Subscribe 

**Event-based architectural style** where there is a **event dispatcher component** (a middleware) which collects subscriptions and is responsible for routing events to matching subscribers. Subscriptions can be either **subject-based** or **content-based**.

Communication in this style is:

 - **Transient**: It is not stored for future reference.
 - **Asynchronous**: Events can be sent and received without waiting for a response.
 - **Implicit**: It does not require direct interaction between sender and recipient.
 - **Multipoint**: Multiple subscribers can receive the same event.

The **dispatcher** in a system can either be **centralized** or **distributed**. It is often the **bottleneck of the system**, especially when dealing with content-based matching, as it is more difficult to match based on content rather than simply matching the topic name.

#### Acyclic graph topology

When the topology of the distributed dispatcher is an **acyclic graph** (graph of brokers) three approaches exists:

- **Message forwarding**: each broker stores only subscriptions coming from directly connected clients (so subs are cheap since only interests the closer node). Messages are forwarded from broker to broker and eventually delivered to clients by the closer node only if they are subscribed.  a lot of subscriptions few publications better using message forwarding.
- **Subscription forwarding**: complementary approach of message forwarding where the subscription propagates through the network. And now if you send a message, the message only gets delivered along the minimal route that goes from the sender to the destination. Subscription is not propagated along route where it's already propagated before. This approach is ok if you have subject based subscriptions, while it's not ok if you have content based subscription because in principle you could have a subscriptions that covers another subscription. This approach is better if you don't subscribe too much and you publish a lot so few subscriptions a lot of publications better using sub subscription forwarding .  
- **Hierarchical forwarding**: the graph is organized as a spanning tree which routes the messages only in the correct branches.

#### Cyclic graph topology

When the topology of the distributed dispatcher is an cyclic graph (graph of brokers) **DHT** approach exists.
**DHT approach**: nodes are organized in a **hash table**. To subscribe for messages having a given subject $S$:

- Calculate a hash of the subject $H_s$ 
- Use the DHT to route toward the node $\operatorname{succ}(H s)$
- While flowing toward $H_s$ leave routing information to return messages back

To publish messages having a given subject $S$

- Calculate a hash of the subject $H s$
- Use the DHT to route toward the node $\operatorname{succ}(H s)$
- While flowing toward $\operatorname{succ}(H s)$ follow back routes toward subscribers

And since the DHT do routing even in cyclic graphs, so even using and leveraging, taking advantage of the fact that the network is cyclic, you may implement, efficiently implement, publish, subscribe, routing on top of the DHT by distributing the routing subject-based system DHT can be used. 
Other approaches proposed in literature and basically never used:

- **Per Source Forwarding (PSF)**:
    - A spanning tree is built to keep a forwarding table organized per source.
    - Each publisher sends messages to all known brokers, which then forward to interested subscribers.
- **Improved Per Source Forwarding (iPSF)**:
    - A spanning tree is built similar to PSF but leverages the concept of indistinguishable sources.
    - Publishers send messages only to brokers with interested subscribers.
    - Advantages include smaller forwarding tables and easier construction.
- **Per Receiver Forwarding (PRF)**:
    - A spanning tree is built for each receiver (subscriber).
    - Subscribers inform brokers of their interests, and brokers request messages from publishers based on these interests, pulling messages based on demand. 

## Stream-oriented communication

Stream-oriented communication is a different model of communication that focuses on streams. Streams are sequences of messages of the same type where their timeliness is important. An example of this is a video stream, where each frame is connected to the next frame.
Transmission modes:

- **Asynchronous**: The data items in a stream are transmitted one after the other without any further timing constraints (apart ordering)
- **Synchronous**: There is a max end-to-end delay for each unit in the data stream
- **Isochronous**: There is max and a min end-to-end delay (bounded **jitter**)

**Jitter** refers to the variation in the time between packets arriving, caused by network congestion, timing drift, or other unpredictable factors.
Which is our best protocol against jitter?
There is no specific protocol, IP protocol is the best effort protocol and does not guarantee quality of service. However, it does have a **Differentiated Services** field in its header, which is used by nobody and even ignored by most of internet providers.
So, since the network doesn't provide anything specific, everything must be done at the application layer:

- **Buffering**: packets are not instantly delivered to the receiver but first they are stored in a buffer.
- **Forward error correction**: is a mechanism used to detect and correct errors in data transmission. Unlike backward error correction, which involves going back to a previous state to correct errors, FEC is a technique where errors are detected and corrected in real-time without needing to resend the data.
- **Interleaving**: instead of sending packets that include consecutive frames, you send packets that mix together different frames. This means that if a packet is lost in transit, consecutive frames will not be lost.
