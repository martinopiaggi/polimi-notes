# Polimi notes 

![](images/polimi-notes.jpg)

This is a collection of my notes for various **Computer Science and Engineering** courses that I attended. The repo includes:

- **Master's degree course notes (Work In Progress):**
    - All notes are in English
    - Some course notes are incomplete since still in progress or boring 
- **Bachelor's degree course notes:**
	- All notes are in Italian, except for Foundations of AI
    - Notes are available only for some courses of the study plan

These notes were created during periods of desperate studying, utilizing both professor-provided materials, resources from fellow students and ChatGPT. They are not intended to be perfect and may be inaccurate and incomplete. If you see any error feel free to open an issue or send a pull request.

## Main features 

- Every course note is divided in macro subjects plain markdown notes but it has also a PDF file.
- Topics are **interconnected** through **markdown links**, allowing for easy navigation and exploration of related topics directly from Github.
- **Courses marked with WIP are incomplete** as I am still working on them, studying them, or procrastinating the note refactoring.
- If you open this repository with [Obsidian.md](https://obsidian.md/) (or similar softwares) you also have a one-click graph visualization of the notes interconnections.
